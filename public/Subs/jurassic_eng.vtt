00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:25.100
Dinosaurs in our world

3
00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:27.194
<i>dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

4
00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:32.188
<i>And with every confrontation we learn
more about this frightening new reality.</i>

5
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.119
<i>How did we get here?</i>

6
00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:41.113
<i>It's been three decades
since the deadly events of Jurassic park,</i>

7
00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:45.117
<i>and we've yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us.</i>

8
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.116
<i>After the devastating eruption
of Isla nublar's long dormant volcano,</i>

9
00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:52.126
<i>those who survived
were transported to the mainland.</i>

10
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:55.126
<i>Many of the larger predators
were captured,</i>

11
00:01:55.324 --> 00:02:00.129
<i>but the remaining creatures
scattered here, in big rock national park.</i>

12
00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:03.922
<i>While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way to civilization</i>

13
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.222
<i>struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

14
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.008
<i>Local authorities have warned,
the animals are unpredictable,</i>

15
00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:12.683
<i>and when hungry, extremely violent.</i>

16
00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:18.146
<i>As the dinosaurs spread across boarders,
a global black market has risen.</i>

17
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.155
<i>Scorn, you suck pathetic loser!</i>

18
00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:24.044
<i>To combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers</i>

19
00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:27.809
<i>the us congress awarded sole
collection rights to the global giant -</i>

<i>biosyn genetics.</i>

21
00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:32.513
<i>At biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea</i>

22
00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:36.178
<i>that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.</i>

23
00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:42.176
<i>Ceo Lewis dodgson has created
a sanctuary in Italy's dolomite mountains</i>

24
00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.095
<i>where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs ancient immune system</i>

25
00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.471
<i>for unique pharmaceutical properties.</i>

26
00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:51.232
<i>While biosyn believes we can handle
genetic power responsibly,</i>

27
00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.192
<i>the public remains skeptical.</i>

28
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.587
<i>Some note that these government contracts</i>

29
00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:59.186
<i>have led to massive spikes
in biosyn's profits.</i>

30
00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.425
<i>And rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared</i>

31
00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:05.226
<i>leading to a world's wide search.</i>

32
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.969
<i>Some believe she's genetically identical
to Charlotte lockwood,</i>

<i>deceased daughter of Jurassic park
co-founder Benjamin lockwood.</i>

34
00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:16.192
<i>Now that we brought these animals
back from extinction,</i>

35
00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:18.138
<i>can we face the consequences?</i>

36
00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:20.277
<i>Are we responsible for them,</i>

37
00:03:20.377 --> 00:03:22.350
<i>or should they be left
to fend for themselves?</i>

38
00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:28.225
<i>As we adapt to an ever-changing world,
we must find answers to these questions.</i>

39
00:03:28.662 --> 00:03:33.308
<i>For their safety as well as for our own.</i>

Saw Ridge cattle co. Nevada.

41
00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:16.274
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

42
00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:23.454
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep cost down. It's medieval.

43
00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:28.356
Claire.

44
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.073
Why do you think he's separated
from the rest?

45
00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:39.385
I don't think he's gonna make it.

46
00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:47.294
No. What are you doing? We report this.

47
00:04:47.377 --> 00:04:52.381
The dfw takes days to investigate.
We can save this one now.

48
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.767
It's all good. It's all good, buddy.

49
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:00.397
Okay, here we go.

50
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.397
Nope. No!

51
00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:10.615
- The head.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.476
Okay, yeah.

53
00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:18.127
Okay, come on, let's go.

54
00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:24.856
- Hold on!
- To what?

55
00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:39.434
Trespassing keep out.

56
00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:51.081
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

57
00:05:57.032 --> 00:05:58.453
No, back, no!

58
00:06:08.342 --> 00:06:09.671
Oh, shit!

59
00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:16.465
- Everybody good?
- No!

60
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.619
Okay, so I think we get this one
to the dfw, and then we hit them again.

61
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:34.775
Yeah, you saw that breeding ground, right?

62
00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:36.844
We're done.

63
00:06:38.472 --> 00:06:41.035
I got a call last week. It's a real job.

64
00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.564
Something I can do to effectively
change things. I gotta take it.

65
00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:45.781
They need us.

66
00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:48.462
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us

67
00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:50.891
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself?

68
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.372
- Claire.
- I mean this is crazy.

69
00:06:54.134 --> 00:06:57.420
Claire, you're doing the right thing.

70
00:06:57.503 --> 00:07:00.842
But this isn't a way
to go about it anymore.

71
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.152
Honestly you need someone
who's good at being shot at.

72
00:07:05.252 --> 00:07:08.435
Aren't you and Owen
still like a weird thing?

73
00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:12.437
- It's not that weird.
- He didn't mean "weird." No.

74
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.528
He meant, like "surprising."

75
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.546
Sierra Nevada mountains.

76
00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:54.942
Let's bring them home!

77
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.642
Okay, come here.

78
00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:05.778
Okay.

79
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.647
We're gonna get you some place safe.

80
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:33.675
Here you go. Here you go.

81
00:12:34.104 --> 00:12:35.292
Hey!

82
00:12:37.543 --> 00:12:40.256
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

83
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:45.244
- What are you burning?
- Nothing. Just some old blankets.

84
00:12:47.574 --> 00:12:49.512
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

85
00:12:49.596 --> 00:12:51.748
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

86
00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:53.032
- Are you?
- No.

87
00:12:53.117 --> 00:12:55.386
Maisie, you're literally
looking everywhere but here.

88
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.208
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

89
00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:04.615
Maisie, can we start over?

90
00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:07.794
I know, Claire, there are people out there
who would do anything to find me.

91
00:13:07.923 --> 00:13:11.369
I'm not angry, that means
you don't have to be angry.

92
00:13:11.453 --> 00:13:12.495
I'm not angry.

93
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.439
- I can take care of myself.
- Hey!

94
00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:19.809
It's okay for us to depend on each other.
That's what people do.

95
00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:22.033
How would I know what people do?

96
00:13:22.727 --> 00:13:26.162
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years are you both.

97
00:13:27.777 --> 00:13:30.539
Besides, I'm not even a real person anyway.

98
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:31.741
What?

99
00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:35.757
I was made from someone else. I'm not me.

100
00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:46.016
You're the only you who ever was.

101
00:13:48.107 --> 00:13:51.944
What? What that, like really corny?

102
00:13:52.044 --> 00:13:53.044
It was so corny.

103
00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:56.111
- Can we keep that between us?
- Can't promise that.

104
00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:04.949
- Hey, kid. Sorry I'm late.
- Hi.

105
00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:11.065
You smell like horses.

106
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:14.532
- Oh, you like that, do you?
- I do. Yeah.

107
00:14:14.616 --> 00:14:15.616
Okay.

108
00:14:17.243 --> 00:14:19.883
I'm gonna make dinner.

109
00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:22.055
Everything okay?

110
00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:24.443
She went into town again.

111
00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.441
Oh, this kid...
Did you talk to her?

112
00:14:30.142 --> 00:14:31.290
I tried.

113
00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:34.996
I'll talk to her.

114
00:16:16.138 --> 00:16:19.068
Cut away from yourself.

115
00:16:25.597 --> 00:16:27.325
- Stone cold.
- Right?

116
00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:29.851
- I would not mess with her.
- No way.

117
00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:39.468
Listen, kiddo, we should probably talk
about you going into town.

118
00:16:40.376 --> 00:16:42.868
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

119
00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:45.837
You're not trapped here,
we just don't trust people.

120
00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:49.806
No, you just don't trust me.
And then you expect me to trust you.

121
00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:52.564
- Why can't I have any freedom?
- Because you can't.

122
00:16:57.971 --> 00:17:00.664
- That went great.
- What is happening?

123
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.217
- She's 14.
- Yeah.

124
00:17:04.317 --> 00:17:05.942
You remember what that was like.

125
00:17:06.782 --> 00:17:08.260
I do.

126
00:17:09.979 --> 00:17:11.929
We can't keep her here forever.

127
00:17:12.343 --> 00:17:15.442
If we don't figure this out she's gonna go
a lot further than the bridge.

128
00:17:15.526 --> 00:17:17.326
If they find her
we never gonna see her again.

129
00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:20.003
We gotta protect her. That's our job.
That's what we are gonna do.

130
00:17:20.063 --> 00:17:23.125
Protect her how? By locking her inside?

131
00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.497
<i>She's got questions.</i>

132
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.526
<i>You know, questions we can't answer.</i>

133
00:17:32.053 --> 00:17:34.002
<i>She wants to know who she is.</i>

134
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.952
<i>Who Charlotte lockwood was.</i>

135
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:46.479
Tracked Grady to his house.

136
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.323
You were right.

137
00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:50.492
Raptor's got a juvenile.

138
00:17:51.953 --> 00:17:53.959
But listen, there's something else.

139
00:17:54.959 --> 00:17:57.133
I found that girl you've been after.

140
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.971
West Texas.

141
00:19:26.273 --> 00:19:27.965
Thanks for coming.

142
00:19:28.048 --> 00:19:30.049
Wasn't sure whom to call.

143
00:19:30.133 --> 00:19:33.313
They said wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

144
00:19:33.397 --> 00:19:35.860
Yeah, well, they get all the attention.

145
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.215
You guy wanna vary the sampling plots
a 100 yards each.

146
00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:40.982
- These are your students?
- Yeah.

147
00:19:41.383 --> 00:19:44.877
We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

148
00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:46.949
So, this is right up our alley.

149
00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:51.993
They hit 60 fields in the county.
You seen anything like this before?

150
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.049
No, not like this.

151
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:57.006
They've been leaving degrading fields
all across the midwest.

152
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.066
First, these big companies
try to kill off all the insects.

153
00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:02.981
Now this.

154
00:20:12.898 --> 00:20:14.239
Is that your land?

155
00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:17.541
That's the bennetts corn.
The locust didn't eat that.

156
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.119
- You plant the same seed as the bennetts?
- No.

157
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.943
We are independent.

158
00:20:24.418 --> 00:20:26.346
They use biosyn seed.

159
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.231
Yeah, I bet they do.

160
00:20:31.525 --> 00:20:33.232
You say you caught a live one?

161
00:20:35.172 --> 00:20:37.952
Utah.

162
00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:45.031
Okay, let it out slow.

163
00:20:46.658 --> 00:20:47.919
- Got it?
- Yeah.

164
00:20:48.626 --> 00:20:49.900
Easy!

165
00:20:56.382 --> 00:20:58.160
Why do we dig?

166
00:20:58.244 --> 00:21:03.613
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

167
00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:05.980
And there is truth in these rocks.

168
00:21:06.312 --> 00:21:07.493
Grant!

169
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.340
You gonna wanna see this.

170
00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.260
Ellie sattler.

171
00:21:26.682 --> 00:21:28.097
Alan Grant.

172
00:21:28.827 --> 00:21:30.501
You look the same.

173
00:21:32.686 --> 00:21:35.486
And this place is so...

174
00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:38.528
So... you.

175
00:21:40.183 --> 00:21:43.742
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming I would...

176
00:21:50.192 --> 00:21:52.159
Can I get you something? A bear? Or...

177
00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:57.114
Maybe not at 10 A.M.
but, ice tea?

178
00:21:57.197 --> 00:21:59.885
Tea, yeah! Tea, I can do that.

179
00:22:01.899 --> 00:22:04.137
Saw a lot of tourists on the way in.

180
00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:06.586
All the funding dried up, so...

181
00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:09.138
Somebody's gotta pay for all of this.

182
00:22:09.654 --> 00:22:10.788
Thank you.

183
00:22:13.002 --> 00:22:17.860
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming. It was great.

184
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.137
Thanks.

185
00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:21.090
Could be grounds for some hope
for a change.

186
00:22:21.944 --> 00:22:23.261
How are your kids?

187
00:22:24.798 --> 00:22:27.777
Amazing. Grown, it's shocking.

188
00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:30.151
They're both in college,
can you believe that?

189
00:22:30.235 --> 00:22:31.633
And Mark?

190
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:35.244
It's over.

191
00:22:38.843 --> 00:22:40.167
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

192
00:22:40.758 --> 00:22:44.635
It's okay. I'm back to me, and my work.

193
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.159
And now it's...

194
00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:48.676
- That's great.
- That's good. It is.

195
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.169
I'm alone at last.

196
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.843
Exciting times.

197
00:22:51.927 --> 00:22:54.490
Yeah, I'm living that Alan Grant life.

198
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:56.152
- It's just...
- Can be lonely.

199
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:57.427
So free.

200
00:23:00.544 --> 00:23:01.846
Ellie...

201
00:23:03.393 --> 00:23:07.376
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up now, did you?

202
00:23:11.645 --> 00:23:15.830
It's a locust.
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

203
00:23:16.727 --> 00:23:18.619
God, the size of it is massive.

204
00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:23.212
It has genes that had been extinct
since the cretaceous.

205
00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:27.044
And swarms of them are decimating
crops from Iowa to Texas.

206
00:23:28.098 --> 00:23:29.296
Terrifying, right?

207
00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:31.727
Started as a few hundred.

208
00:23:31.887 --> 00:23:34.248
It could be millions
by the end of this summer.

209
00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:38.303
If they keep going there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

210
00:23:38.387 --> 00:23:40.558
The entire food chain would collapse.

211
00:23:40.642 --> 00:23:44.318
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

212
00:23:45.742 --> 00:23:50.113
None of the crops they're eating
are biosyn seed.

213
00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:51.197
Biosyn.

214
00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:53.645
You're saying biosyn made this?

215
00:23:54.092 --> 00:23:58.240
It would not shock me that they wanna
control the world's food supply.

216
00:23:58.323 --> 00:24:01.612
- Not before a few millions starve.
- Now, what is that saying?

217
00:24:01.696 --> 00:24:04.605
"We are three meals away from anarchy."

218
00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:07.738
If we don't stop them
you can pick your last three meals.

219
00:24:10.206 --> 00:24:12.288
So, why are you bringing it to me?

220
00:24:12.575 --> 00:24:15.712
I need concrete evidence
biosyn's responsible for all this.

221
00:24:15.817 --> 00:24:20.033
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

222
00:24:21.656 --> 00:24:23.359
But I need a witness.

223
00:24:24.187 --> 00:24:25.310
Alan...

224
00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:28.620
You command respect. People believe you.

225
00:24:29.282 --> 00:24:30.543
Yeah.

226
00:24:30.627 --> 00:24:33.787
You know why I'm here?
It's quiet. I'm done with all of that.

227
00:24:33.871 --> 00:24:35.372
Are you? Okay.

228
00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:41.067
Well, I'm sorry, Alan. Nobody gets
that luxury anymore, not even you.

229
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.540
And you know what?

230
00:24:43.987 --> 00:24:45.815
You are the one I trust.

231
00:24:49.548 --> 00:24:53.382
This biosyn's sanctuary is what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

232
00:24:53.476 --> 00:24:54.787
How would you even get in there?

233
00:24:54.925 --> 00:24:58.911
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

234
00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:02.829
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

235
00:25:02.913 --> 00:25:06.387
And he just happen to invite you
out of the blue?

236
00:25:07.387 --> 00:25:09.740
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

237
00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:17.402
You coming or what?

238
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.540
U.S. wildlife relocation facility
Pennsylvania

239
00:25:24.263 --> 00:25:25.356
come on!

240
00:25:26.311 --> 00:25:27.584
It's clear!

241
00:25:32.404 --> 00:25:35.007
Every animal captured on the mainland
comes through here

242
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:37.796
before shipping out
to biosyn's sanctuary in dolomites.

243
00:25:37.897 --> 00:25:41.339
We give them the medical attention
and make sure they live healthy.

244
00:25:41.422 --> 00:25:44.666
- So much security.
- Those are just the ones you see.

245
00:25:45.007 --> 00:25:47.309
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

246
00:25:49.636 --> 00:25:51.204
Your plane is just fueling up.

247
00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:55.225
Biosyn's a tough invite,
you guys must know somebody.

248
00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:56.833
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course.

249
00:25:59.084 --> 00:26:00.333
Hi there.

250
00:26:02.455 --> 00:26:03.646
Follow me.

251
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.322
We rescued these guys from an illegal
breeding farm in Nevada a few weeks ago.

252
00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:10.452
Shut the whole place down. Anonymous tip.

253
00:26:11.546 --> 00:26:14.461
Good girl. Yes, yes.

254
00:26:15.928 --> 00:26:19.383
Alan, you never get used to it.

255
00:26:20.368 --> 00:26:21.783
- Take care. Thank you.
- Bye.

256
00:26:59.793 --> 00:27:00.992
Hey.

257
00:27:03.028 --> 00:27:04.686
You look just like blue.

258
00:27:05.655 --> 00:27:07.137
Is she your mother?

259
00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:11.491
This? You wanna try it?

260
00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:13.419
Okay.

261
00:27:28.453 --> 00:27:30.348
Maisie, don't move..

262
00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:36.535
Hey, girl. Staying out of trouble?

263
00:27:37.535 --> 00:27:39.417
She had a baby. That's impossible.

264
00:27:42.386 --> 00:27:44.874
- Back up.
- She won't hurt us, right?

265
00:27:44.969 --> 00:27:47.414
Oh, you damn right she will. Just breathe.

266
00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:49.471
If you don't she'll think you're scared.

267
00:27:49.555 --> 00:27:50.785
I am scared.

268
00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:53.855
She doesn't need to know that.

269
00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:04.534
Her nest has got to be nearby.
Maisie get inside.

270
00:28:04.618 --> 00:28:06.632
- I'm coming with you.
- What did I just say?

271
00:28:17.015 --> 00:28:19.611
- We gotta move.
<i>- Not yet, we need the girl.</i>

272
00:28:21.918 --> 00:28:23.591
Hey, what's up?

273
00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:28.318
Maisie?

274
00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:30.594
Maisie?

275
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.059
Where are you going?

276
00:28:38.143 --> 00:28:40.114
You can't keep me here,
you're not my mother.

277
00:28:46.344 --> 00:28:47.965
She's leaving the house.

278
00:29:15.017 --> 00:29:16.471
- Time to go!
- Come on let's go!

279
00:29:42.661 --> 00:29:44.193
Who are you?

280
00:30:05.347 --> 00:30:06.582
Claire!

281
00:30:07.189 --> 00:30:08.200
They found her.

282
00:30:08.284 --> 00:30:09.732
What? Who are they?

283
00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:12.233
Poachers, I've seen them around.

284
00:30:12.317 --> 00:30:13.656
Leader's a real shit heel.

285
00:30:13.757 --> 00:30:15.953
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

286
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:18.137
- Where is she?
- Go get the truck.

287
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:19.418
Oh, my god.

288
00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:28.125
Owen!

289
00:30:28.167 --> 00:30:29.541
Hey! No.

290
00:30:34.202 --> 00:30:36.274
They took her kid too.

291
00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:43.368
I am gonna get her back.
I promise you that.

292
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:56.449
Come on. I know whom to call.

293
00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:08.754
Central intelligence agency
dangerous species division.

294
00:31:15.935 --> 00:31:17.686
This year, man. What's next?

295
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.277
Historically? Darkness, blood,
reign of fire.

296
00:31:21.361 --> 00:31:22.381
I think frogs.

297
00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:24.433
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

298
00:31:24.517 --> 00:31:26.429
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

299
00:31:26.453 --> 00:31:27.601
They're in the corn, wheat.

300
00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:29.805
Basically whole of our food
and our food's food, so...

301
00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.186
We can say goodbye to this.

302
00:31:34.865 --> 00:31:37.765
- Hello?
<i>- Franklin, it's me. You're at work?</i>

303
00:31:38.503 --> 00:31:40.315
You're kinda subject of interest
around here,

304
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:42.122
so I can't really be talking to you.

305
00:31:42.207 --> 00:31:44.824
<i>Come, on, I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.</i>

306
00:31:44.908 --> 00:31:46.123
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

307
00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:48.221
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

308
00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:49.454
<i>We're outside.</i>

309
00:31:51.663 --> 00:31:53.038
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

310
00:31:56.997 --> 00:31:59.042
- Is that him?
- That's him.

311
00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:02.800
Name's rainn delacourt.
A real piece of work.

312
00:32:03.372 --> 00:32:04.593
What did he take?

313
00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:07.352
Something we care about very much.

314
00:32:08.146 --> 00:32:11.228
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

315
00:32:11.313 --> 00:32:12.880
You can't just take a person, Claire.

316
00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:14.936
- I had no choice.
- Not in the eyes of the law.

317
00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:17.894
This guy is not the "law."
Tell us how to find him.

318
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:21.605
What did you guys call me from?

319
00:32:23.323 --> 00:32:25.751
We have a man on the inside
of delacourt's operation.

320
00:32:25.835 --> 00:32:28.411
There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow, cash for cargo.

321
00:32:28.904 --> 00:32:30.095
Is she with him?

322
00:32:30.593 --> 00:32:34.324
There's no mention, but we have people
on the ground already.

323
00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:35.346
One of them you know.

324
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.307
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA
after the park went down.

325
00:32:39.968 --> 00:32:41.856
Barry's French intelligence now.

326
00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:47.010
- I need to talk to him.
- You can't just call him. He's deep cover.

327
00:32:47.228 --> 00:32:49.071
Look, once we make the bust in Malta

328
00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:51.160
our guys will see if delacourt knows
where she is.

329
00:32:51.645 --> 00:32:53.927
Our guys, not you.

330
00:32:54.399 --> 00:32:58.668
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

331
00:32:59.829 --> 00:33:00.944
Why would I do that?

332
00:33:02.321 --> 00:33:05.043
Look, you guys are both crazy.

333
00:33:05.927 --> 00:33:09.037
But you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

334
00:33:09.536 --> 00:33:10.657
She's lucky to have you.

335
00:33:12.673 --> 00:33:14.393
Don't get killed, okay?

336
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.306
I think we're almost there.

337
00:33:35.462 --> 00:33:36.462
Yeah.

338
00:33:37.159 --> 00:33:40.794
Biosyn sanctuary
dolomite mountains, Italy.

339
00:33:49.842 --> 00:33:53.119
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
ramsay Cole, communications.

340
00:33:53.203 --> 00:33:54.137
Oh, hey.

341
00:33:54.221 --> 00:33:56.513
I have to warn you,
everyone is so excited to have you.

342
00:33:56.613 --> 00:33:59.181
You guys are absolute legends around here.

343
00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:01.964
You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

344
00:34:02.078 --> 00:34:05.598
You know, it's great that you guys
are still so close to Dr. Malcolm.

345
00:34:05.695 --> 00:34:07.921
Sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

346
00:34:08.021 --> 00:34:10.496
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

347
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.658
Such motility of thought, it's incredible.

348
00:34:12.742 --> 00:34:14.310
How much time did you spend with him?

349
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:19.027
Well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

350
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.192
Please, after you. And watch your head.

351
00:34:28.382 --> 00:34:31.279
So, biosyn bought this land for the Amber
deposits back in the nineties,

352
00:34:31.362 --> 00:34:33.167
but we've managed to turn into
a safe haven

353
00:34:33.266 --> 00:34:34.978
for about 20 displaced species.

354
00:34:35.304 --> 00:34:38.803
The first generation came from sorna.
Most of the nublar dinosaurs are here too.

355
00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:41.744
Took fish and wildlife three years
to catch the t-Rex.

356
00:34:42.516 --> 00:34:44.411
The t-Rex is here?

357
00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:46.367
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

358
00:34:47.163 --> 00:34:49.232
Arrived just before you guys.

359
00:35:06.307 --> 00:35:09.162
<i>Aerial deterrent system - active.</i>

360
00:35:09.543 --> 00:35:12.330
Restricted aerial space.
Protects the airborne life.

361
00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:14.760
Keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet.

362
00:35:14.973 --> 00:35:16.128
Airborne?

363
00:35:18.614 --> 00:35:20.423
Is that dreadnoughtus?

364
00:35:21.164 --> 00:35:22.164
What?

365
00:35:29.258 --> 00:35:30.660
Beautiful, right?

366
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.744
Her name means "fear nothing."
I guess you know that.

367
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.192
- What do they graze on?
- All Thorn and fern.

368
00:35:37.651 --> 00:35:41.040
All indigenous, nothing stocked,
except for the deer population.

369
00:35:41.124 --> 00:35:43.636
It's a great mesenchyme species
for the apex predator.

370
00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:47.704
- The apex predator?
- Giganotosaurus.

371
00:35:48.998 --> 00:35:50.290
At least for now.

372
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.220
You don't let people in there, right?

373
00:36:03.626 --> 00:36:08.910
No. Our research outposts
are connected completely underground.

374
00:36:09.008 --> 00:36:11.767
If we have to we can just
herd the animals remotely

375
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:16.154
using neural implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain.

376
00:36:16.238 --> 00:36:18.323
Like shocks?

377
00:36:18.407 --> 00:36:20.005
No, like signals.

378
00:36:20.687 --> 00:36:23.197
Does it strike you as a little bit...

379
00:36:23.304 --> 00:36:24.364
- Cruel?
- Cruel.

380
00:36:25.272 --> 00:36:28.669
Do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at Jurassic park?

381
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.131
Yeah.

382
00:36:36.936 --> 00:36:38.878
<i>Please join Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon</i>

383
00:36:38.962 --> 00:36:41.441
<i>in the lecture hall
for the "ethics of genetic power."</i>

384
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.790
God, everyone's so young.

385
00:36:43.874 --> 00:36:47.111
Well, it is part of our ethos
to track the best and brightest.

386
00:36:47.744 --> 00:36:50.697
Doctors. Respected, renowned.

387
00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:53.509
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant. Hi.

388
00:36:54.609 --> 00:36:56.153
Wow, this is big, I'm Lewis.

389
00:36:56.237 --> 00:36:58.267
- Dodgson. Yeah.
- Hi.

390
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.150
- You're Lewis dodgson?
- I am. How do you do?

391
00:37:00.214 --> 00:37:02.032
We didn't expect to actually see you here.

392
00:37:02.116 --> 00:37:04.425
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

393
00:37:04.509 --> 00:37:06.157
- Would you?
- No.

394
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:08.779
I mean, people you see here
are changing the world.

395
00:37:09.472 --> 00:37:11.205
Would you mind if we...

396
00:37:12.299 --> 00:37:14.089
It would mean a lot if...

397
00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:15.204
Do you wanna...

398
00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:17.683
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

399
00:37:18.123 --> 00:37:19.994
That's good. That's good. Thanks.

400
00:37:20.078 --> 00:37:24.301
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

401
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:28.511
We're unlocking the true power
of the genome.

402
00:37:28.596 --> 00:37:30.013
We're this close, believe me.

403
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.316
- You'll make a fortune off that.
- No, it's not about money.

404
00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:37.899
No, we've already identified
dozens of applications for paleo DNA.

405
00:37:37.986 --> 00:37:40.968
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

406
00:37:41.052 --> 00:37:42.856
We will be saving lives.

407
00:37:43.437 --> 00:37:44.679
I bet.

408
00:37:45.338 --> 00:37:47.883
Anyway, I wish I could take
you around myself, but...

409
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:51.998
So, you're in more than capable
hands with ramsay.

410
00:37:52.592 --> 00:37:55.232
He's basically a young me.

411
00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:58.905
Only smarter and taller.

412
00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:01.274
Do you have food?

413
00:38:02.002 --> 00:38:03.677
- Like, one of my bars?
- Pardon?

414
00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:06.327
No, never mind, I'll find something.

415
00:38:06.462 --> 00:38:09.899
So, I wanna do more of this
later on if we...

416
00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:14.256
Oh, we booked you on a private pod
for the trip out, so...

417
00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:17.532
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

418
00:38:17.587 --> 00:38:18.964
You better hurry, Malcolm's on.

419
00:38:19.048 --> 00:38:21.194
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

420
00:38:21.278 --> 00:38:23.215
He keeps us on our toes.
Anyway...

421
00:38:23.737 --> 00:38:25.463
Thank you for being here, it's...

422
00:38:28.278 --> 00:38:30.400
Okay, follow me, please.

423
00:38:32.636 --> 00:38:33.636
What?

424
00:38:33.877 --> 00:38:39.367
Human beings have no more right
to safety or Liberty

425
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.453
than any other creature on this planet.

426
00:38:44.453 --> 00:38:48.088
We not only lack dominion over nature,

427
00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:51.283
we're subordinate to it.

428
00:38:51.968 --> 00:38:56.953
And now here we are, with the opportunity
to rewrite life at our fingertips.

429
00:38:57.037 --> 00:38:58.731
And just like with nuclear power,

430
00:38:58.815 --> 00:39:01.957
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

431
00:39:02.041 --> 00:39:05.637
but they pressed
the button and hoped for the best.

432
00:39:06.986 --> 00:39:09.408
Just like you are doing now.

433
00:39:10.717 --> 00:39:12.945
Yep, you.

434
00:39:14.176 --> 00:39:19.415
You control the future
of our survival on planet earth.

435
00:39:19.912 --> 00:39:22.285
According to you
the solution is genetic power.

436
00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:26.097
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

437
00:39:26.437 --> 00:39:30.766
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

438
00:39:31.353 --> 00:39:34.506
Unforeseen consequences occur.

439
00:39:35.502 --> 00:39:39.894
And every time. Every single time

440
00:39:41.513 --> 00:39:43.111
we all act surprised.

441
00:39:44.085 --> 00:39:47.848
Because deep down I don't think
that any of us actually believe

442
00:39:47.932 --> 00:39:49.834
that these dangers are real.

443
00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.456
In order to instigate revolutionary change

444
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:06.548
we must transform human consciousness.

445
00:40:14.506 --> 00:40:15.560
May am?

446
00:40:17.074 --> 00:40:18.899
Very good. There you go.

447
00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.677
I don't want to be rude to my friends.

448
00:40:20.762 --> 00:40:23.237
Catch me on my way out. Thanks everybody.

449
00:40:24.115 --> 00:40:28.563
Look at you. Look at me, and look at you.

450
00:40:29.137 --> 00:40:31.008
Whoa, this is so trippy.

451
00:40:31.122 --> 00:40:32.482
You look like you're doing well.

452
00:40:32.566 --> 00:40:35.887
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

453
00:40:36.699 --> 00:40:37.699
Expenses add up.

454
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:39.690
You? Alan, are you...

455
00:40:40.646 --> 00:40:42.048
You have any family or?

456
00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:44.067
No.

457
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.086
- I need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you too, privately.

458
00:40:48.482 --> 00:40:49.913
Do you two talk a lot?

459
00:40:49.997 --> 00:40:51.666
He slid into my dms.

460
00:40:51.751 --> 00:40:53.319
- He did what?
- It's urgent, Ian.

461
00:40:53.403 --> 00:40:56.326
- What did you do?
- Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

462
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.917
The doomsday clock might be
about out of time, but as they say,

463
00:41:00.001 --> 00:41:03.800
it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

464
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.608
What?

465
00:41:07.354 --> 00:41:11.119
Locusts altered with cretaceous era DNA...

466
00:41:11.203 --> 00:41:12.111
That's not my field.

467
00:41:12.195 --> 00:41:13.862
But if these things continue to multiply

468
00:41:13.946 --> 00:41:16.796
we're talking about cascading
system-wide effects, Ian.

469
00:41:17.194 --> 00:41:21.075
- Gosh, that's a drag.
- What is the matter with you?

470
00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:23.211
Why, is there something special
you want me to do?

471
00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:24.988
How about give a damn?

472
00:41:25.098 --> 00:41:29.048
Hey, I gave my opinion robustly for years.

473
00:41:29.132 --> 00:41:32.137
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation.

474
00:41:32.787 --> 00:41:36.296
And the only play now
is to take the time we have left

475
00:41:37.464 --> 00:41:39.810
and, you know, just like
we always do, squander it.

476
00:41:39.894 --> 00:41:42.393
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

477
00:41:42.477 --> 00:41:44.916
Can I offer you guys some Joe?

478
00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:49.032
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

479
00:41:49.116 --> 00:41:50.206
I don't want a cappuccino.

480
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.342
Well, I can do a cortado
or, like, macchiato?

481
00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:56.226
Trust me, it's real tough that jet lag,
that's gonna perk you right up.

482
00:42:00.356 --> 00:42:03.188
The locusts are a part of a larger project
called hexapod allies.

483
00:42:03.272 --> 00:42:04.997
You were right about their regiment.

484
00:42:05.081 --> 00:42:07.292
I just heard here a rumor six weeks ago.

485
00:42:07.376 --> 00:42:09.416
I read your piece
on decadence and put two and two together.

486
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.704
- I was not raising my voice.
- You're beginning to.

487
00:42:11.788 --> 00:42:12.718
It's what you're doing.

488
00:42:12.802 --> 00:42:16.580
They proliferating wildly. They're lasting
three-four times longer than they should.

489
00:42:16.664 --> 00:42:20.509
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

490
00:42:20.593 --> 00:42:24.250
Downstairs. Sub-level 6.
That's where they keep the locusts.

491
00:42:24.334 --> 00:42:26.619
Look for a lab marked l4.

492
00:42:26.733 --> 00:42:28.581
But wait, how are we ever
gonna get down there?

493
00:42:28.665 --> 00:42:31.224
Hey, this looks so silky,
may I touch this blouse?

494
00:42:31.308 --> 00:42:32.181
Sure.

495
00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:34.009
You know what it is? Don't tell me.

496
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:36.671
- You won't know it.
- This is sustainable bamboo.

497
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:40.197
It is sustainable bamboo,
how did you know that?

498
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:41.191
Yeah, it's amazing.

499
00:42:41.275 --> 00:42:43.098
I've got a cumin, I've got cinnamon,

500
00:42:43.182 --> 00:42:45.687
I've got allspice, which is not
very popular. I've got five spice...

501
00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:47.970
- Doctor.
- If you're into that kinda feel.

502
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.185
- Yeah.
- Let's talk milks, okay?

503
00:42:51.432 --> 00:42:53.020
Soy milk, yes?

504
00:42:54.233 --> 00:42:55.233
No.

505
00:42:55.287 --> 00:42:57.089
What just happened?

506
00:42:57.173 --> 00:42:58.690
We're in.

507
00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:14.729
<i>Sub-level 6. Restricted.</i>

508
00:43:21.504 --> 00:43:23.542
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

509
00:43:23.626 --> 00:43:27.353
The locusts prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

510
00:43:27.456 --> 00:43:30.521
They're multiplying like crazy,
and they're not dying.

511
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.173
- What part of this don't you understand?
- Oh, I do understand.

512
00:43:33.257 --> 00:43:37.350
- This is gonna be a global famine.
- Hey, we can't anticipate everything.

513
00:43:37.434 --> 00:43:39.439
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

514
00:43:39.523 --> 00:43:41.154
- What?
- All of them.

515
00:43:41.238 --> 00:43:42.551
No. No.

516
00:43:42.635 --> 00:43:46.533
Henry, we don't wanna cause a panic,
we want control.

517
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:48.609
These is no such thing.

518
00:44:01.356 --> 00:44:06.362
When we're afraid what do we do?
What have we done before?

519
00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:11.280
We follow through. That's what we do.

520
00:44:11.363 --> 00:44:12.382
Right?

521
00:44:15.082 --> 00:44:16.098
Right.

522
00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:21.936
We found the girl. She's en route.

523
00:44:22.511 --> 00:44:24.303
- Cost me a fortune.
- What?

524
00:44:25.237 --> 00:44:26.321
Wait, you found her?

525
00:44:26.405 --> 00:44:28.787
Yeah, found them both.
Her and the little raptor.

526
00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:31.977
Blue reproduced all on her own.

527
00:44:33.065 --> 00:44:35.554
Just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.

528
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.028
That's why this works.

529
00:44:39.848 --> 00:44:43.305
You understand the value of these
creatures, you always have. I do too.

530
00:44:43.812 --> 00:44:45.745
And we don't stop because of what,

531
00:44:46.179 --> 00:44:47.907
little side project went south?

532
00:44:49.015 --> 00:44:50.015
Hey.

533
00:44:50.315 --> 00:44:54.339
If they trace the locusts back to us,
they come for the dinosaurs.

534
00:44:54.795 --> 00:44:56.329
All your work gone.

535
00:44:57.217 --> 00:45:00.073
Billions of dollars in assets gone.

536
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.142
Diamonds with no one to mine them.

537
00:45:05.577 --> 00:45:07.432
You really think she's the solution?

538
00:45:10.731 --> 00:45:11.731
Okay.

539
00:45:13.898 --> 00:45:16.399
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

540
00:45:18.288 --> 00:45:19.315
Is she all right?

541
00:45:20.163 --> 00:45:21.362
She better be.

542
00:45:22.713 --> 00:45:25.192
She's the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet.

543
00:45:26.334 --> 00:45:28.356
Malta.

544
00:45:35.442 --> 00:45:38.042
- I said I'd call you.
- They land yet?

545
00:45:38.622 --> 00:45:39.899
<i>Second plane is incoming.</i>

546
00:45:39.983 --> 00:45:41.623
Who said anything about the second plane?

547
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.359
We flew them separately,
I'm not taking any chances.

548
00:45:44.774 --> 00:45:46.492
<i>And we'll need payment before delivery.</i>

549
00:45:46.576 --> 00:45:48.663
I didn't like what happened last time.

550
00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.353
Okay. Okay.

551
00:45:51.337 --> 00:45:52.776
Just call me when it's done.

552
00:46:02.237 --> 00:46:04.209
You said I was going some place safe.

553
00:46:04.763 --> 00:46:05.804
You are.

554
00:46:13.778 --> 00:46:15.200
Walk to the car.

555
00:46:15.974 --> 00:46:16.974
No.

556
00:46:17.182 --> 00:46:18.504
It's not a choice.

557
00:46:31.175 --> 00:46:35.130
Fifty grand to fly
one little raptor. Not bad.

558
00:46:41.802 --> 00:46:43.531
What's with the girl?

559
00:46:45.518 --> 00:46:47.062
Not your problem.

560
00:46:55.462 --> 00:46:57.543
Pleasure doing business.

561
00:47:00.909 --> 00:47:02.171
We're ready, let's go.

562
00:47:09.339 --> 00:47:10.339
Owen.

563
00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:17.046
Hi, Claire.

564
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:19.380
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

565
00:47:19.564 --> 00:47:22.612
I tried, my cousin and I opened a cafe.
I lasted three weeks.

566
00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:26.474
The way that world is headed
it's hard to look away.

567
00:47:27.305 --> 00:47:29.340
Delacourt was hired by soyona Santos,

568
00:47:29.424 --> 00:47:31.780
a broker in the underground
dinosaur trade.

569
00:47:31.864 --> 00:47:33.761
We don't have intel on his cargo.

570
00:47:33.854 --> 00:47:37.761
But once they make an exchange
we'll see what they know about your girl.

571
00:47:37.845 --> 00:47:40.856
You can listen in, but promise me,
you will not make contact.

572
00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.068
No.

573
00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:45.656
All right. See you soon.

574
00:47:46.183 --> 00:47:48.735
There's a big underground market
for dinosaurs now:

575
00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:50.749
Europe, middle east, Northern Africa.

576
00:47:50.833 --> 00:47:52.872
It all comes through here.

577
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:07.018
Don't look at anyone, don't talk
to anyone. Just try to blend in.

578
00:48:44.086 --> 00:48:45.089
I'm okay.

579
00:48:56.959 --> 00:49:00.656
Still flying for Santos, huh?
You must need money.

580
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.010
What's it to you?

581
00:49:02.093 --> 00:49:03.741
I've got cargo.

582
00:49:04.336 --> 00:49:07.001
A thousand kilos
of dinosaur to palermo.

583
00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:08.586
I give you two thousand.

584
00:49:09.317 --> 00:49:11.593
Two thousand? How much is there?

585
00:49:21.497 --> 00:49:22.784
You lost?

586
00:49:23.532 --> 00:49:24.840
You're American.

587
00:49:26.323 --> 00:49:27.524
That makes us friends?

588
00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.820
Listen, I just got here and...

589
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.498
No, that was not an invitation. Here.

590
00:49:34.689 --> 00:49:37.067
A souvenir. Go back to the hotel.

591
00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:39.280
You know, throw some bath salts
in the bath.

592
00:49:39.364 --> 00:49:41.638
This place is not your vibe.

593
00:49:42.125 --> 00:49:43.367
Wait.

594
00:49:43.913 --> 00:49:45.620
- Look...
- Claire.

595
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.124
Claire, I know this must feel exotic,

596
00:49:49.215 --> 00:49:53.084
but if you mess with the wrong person
down here you disappear.

597
00:49:53.168 --> 00:49:54.633
You feel me?

598
00:49:54.717 --> 00:49:56.194
Good luck, okay?

599
00:49:56.278 --> 00:49:57.278
Wait.

600
00:49:59.962 --> 00:50:01.353
- Wait.
- What is this?

601
00:50:01.444 --> 00:50:03.483
- I need your help.
- I don't know you.

602
00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.699
- I'm looking for someone.
- Don't do that.

603
00:50:05.783 --> 00:50:07.845
She is all alone. Please.

604
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.530
- Is that your daughter?
- Yes.

605
00:50:18.729 --> 00:50:20.087
Sorry, I can't get involved.

606
00:50:39.934 --> 00:50:42.289
- I think I got him.
- Target on the move.

607
00:50:42.877 --> 00:50:44.683
That's our undercover agent with him.

608
00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:47.759
Claire, he's headed underground.
You see him?

609
00:50:48.019 --> 00:50:49.348
Yeah, I've got him.

610
00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:51.905
All right, let's go.

611
00:50:57.913 --> 00:50:58.913
Hey, how you've been?

612
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.091
<i>All units stay at bulls eye position.</i>

613
00:51:02.933 --> 00:51:06.735
<i>This is bravo 1. Primary target inside.
No sign of the girl.</i>

614
00:51:19.262 --> 00:51:22.339
My people say the raptor arrived
in good condition.

615
00:51:22.993 --> 00:51:24.833
You boys didn't cuck this up.

616
00:51:25.428 --> 00:51:26.716
Call me amazed.

617
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:30.054
I do have another job for you.
Short, hot money's double.

618
00:51:30.528 --> 00:51:31.542
What's the cargo?

619
00:51:34.058 --> 00:51:36.911
Atrociraptors, thoroughbreds.

620
00:51:37.685 --> 00:51:38.784
Trained to kill.

621
00:51:39.044 --> 00:51:39.915
Kill who?

622
00:51:39.999 --> 00:51:41.473
Whoever they're told.

623
00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:44.920
Laser marks the target, they attach
the scent, don't stop till it's dead.

624
00:51:45.004 --> 00:51:46.004
Inescapable.

625
00:51:46.355 --> 00:51:48.333
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

626
00:51:48.975 --> 00:51:52.084
You can't engineer loyalty,
you have to nurture it.

627
00:51:52.936 --> 00:51:54.916
Fifty thousand to fly them to Riyadh.

628
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.706
"In" or "out"?

629
00:51:57.754 --> 00:51:58.754
She's not here.

630
00:52:03.602 --> 00:52:04.765
Where are we going?

631
00:52:05.559 --> 00:52:06.687
Almost there.

632
00:52:12.685 --> 00:52:14.030
<i>That's the draft. Let's go!</i>

633
00:52:14.428 --> 00:52:15.719
Everyone's down!

634
00:52:16.481 --> 00:52:18.170
- Hands in the air!
- Drop your guns!

635
00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:20.310
Delacourt, on the floor, now!

636
00:52:20.394 --> 00:52:21.611
Get on the ground!

637
00:52:21.695 --> 00:52:23.007
Delacourt, stay with!

638
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:24.205
Shit.

639
00:52:25.832 --> 00:52:27.319
Get that truck out of here!

640
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:28.938
Santos, stay still!

641
00:52:35.981 --> 00:52:37.418
<i>We've lost delacourt.</i>

642
00:52:49.669 --> 00:52:52.398
This is bravo 1.
The truck approaching the underpass.

643
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.440
Go.

644
00:54:23.667 --> 00:54:26.235
The girl. Where is she?
Where did they take her?

645
00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:28.360
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

646
00:54:28.444 --> 00:54:31.829
We handed her off to Santos.
I don't know where they took her after.

647
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.851
Claire, it's Santos, the one in white.

648
00:54:47.935 --> 00:54:48.935
I'll find her.

649
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:56.951
Hold it.

650
00:54:57.487 --> 00:54:59.710
- Let them out.
- What?

651
00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:01.205
You heard me.

652
00:55:27.565 --> 00:55:28.565
Damn.

653
00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:31.721
Shit.

654
00:55:45.756 --> 00:55:47.186
<i>Claire, do you have her?</i>

655
00:56:01.266 --> 00:56:02.340
We had some trouble.

656
00:56:02.424 --> 00:56:03.271
What kind?

657
00:56:03.355 --> 00:56:06.503
<i>The parents, Grady and dearing.
They're here.</i>

658
00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:12.333
Can you take care of it?

659
00:56:12.417 --> 00:56:13.417
Not for free.

660
00:56:14.922 --> 00:56:15.935
Well, do it.

661
00:56:30.193 --> 00:56:31.560
Okay, okay. Listen.

662
00:56:46.878 --> 00:56:48.778
You don't use it on people.

663
00:56:48.869 --> 00:56:50.421
Where's my daughter?

664
00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:52.010
She wasn't yours to begin with.

665
00:56:54.501 --> 00:56:55.962
Tell me.

666
00:56:57.698 --> 00:57:00.869
Biosyn. They're taking her to biosyn.

667
00:57:07.816 --> 00:57:10.298
You missed her. She's gone.

668
00:58:03.023 --> 00:58:04.610
Take my hand. Come on!

669
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:36.591
Hold on tight.

670
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.060
What?

671
00:58:49.081 --> 00:58:51.281
Do you remember
how we used to get raptors in the truck?

672
00:58:51.337 --> 00:58:52.491
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

673
00:58:54.415 --> 00:58:55.652
- You're up.
- No.

674
00:58:57.571 --> 00:58:59.315
The last minute dive roll.

675
00:58:59.399 --> 00:59:00.319
I don't dive roll.

676
00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.403
You'll be fine.

677
00:59:01.997 --> 00:59:03.584
I never got the timing right.

678
00:59:05.419 --> 00:59:07.687
- Now?
- Any minute. Any minute now.

679
00:59:08.421 --> 00:59:09.421
Now?

680
00:59:09.765 --> 00:59:10.765
No.

681
00:59:12.387 --> 00:59:13.387
Now!

682
00:59:20.842 --> 00:59:22.247
Freeze!

683
00:59:29.113 --> 00:59:31.511
I'll fly us outta here.
Tell me where you wanna be dropped.

684
00:59:31.969 --> 00:59:33.573
You ever flown to biosyn?

685
00:59:34.998 --> 00:59:36.954
<i>Owen, they took her to biosyn.</i>

686
00:59:37.038 --> 00:59:40.022
<i>There's an airfield on the north side
of the island.</i>

687
00:59:40.106 --> 00:59:42.140
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.

688
01:00:09.485 --> 01:00:10.485
Right!

689
01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:16.286
Get down!

690
01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:57.268
We made a lot of enemies. We gotta go.

691
01:01:57.352 --> 01:01:58.556
He'll be here.

692
01:02:02.759 --> 01:02:04.278
Out of time. Out of time.

693
01:02:07.133 --> 01:02:08.267
There he is.

694
01:02:10.492 --> 01:02:12.282
- Pull over.
- That's not how planes work.

695
01:02:12.366 --> 01:02:13.695
Sub. T.

696
01:02:18.912 --> 01:02:20.291
Open the back.

697
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.635
Come on!

698
01:02:45.379 --> 01:02:47.108
Hold on tight!

699
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.788
Still got it.

700
01:03:37.844 --> 01:03:39.381
Kayla watts.

701
01:03:40.207 --> 01:03:41.291
You're welcome.

702
01:03:42.315 --> 01:03:44.014
You look like you fly for biosyn.

703
01:03:44.142 --> 01:03:47.289
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

704
01:03:47.373 --> 01:03:50.563
I fly for whoever got a bag,
but we'll call this one a favor.

705
01:03:50.647 --> 01:03:52.629
Those don't work. They broke.

706
01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:57.065
I'll take y'all to biosyn
but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

707
01:03:57.845 --> 01:04:00.565
You're willing to risk your life
for people you've never met?

708
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.305
You wanna ask questions or you wanna ride?

709
01:04:08.286 --> 01:04:09.527
We'll take the ride.

710
01:04:16.862 --> 01:04:21.019
So, this is our habitat development lab.
A lot of exciting discoveries as of late.

711
01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:24.008
We've brought back numerous species
in their purest form.

712
01:04:24.092 --> 01:04:26.674
And I mean complete untouched genomes.

713
01:04:26.758 --> 01:04:28.328
Like moros intrepidus.

714
01:04:28.412 --> 01:04:29.553
What?

715
01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.035
Wow.

716
01:04:35.857 --> 01:04:39.817
What about splicing DNA,
you know, creating new species?

717
01:04:39.901 --> 01:04:42.696
No, Dr. Sattler, we don't do that here.

718
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.312
We like to think we're more evolved.

719
01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:51.638
Okay, looks like we still have some
time left before your ride.

720
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:54.947
Would you guys like
to tour the facilities yourselves?

721
01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:59.068
I mean, we could?

722
01:04:59.152 --> 01:04:59.996
Yeah, why not.

723
01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.366
Great, I'll meet you guys
at the hyperloop station 3

724
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.309
in about 30 minutes.

725
01:05:05.394 --> 01:05:07.897
Elevators are down this hall. Not those.

726
01:05:08.563 --> 01:05:10.542
Those lead you down to the sub-levels.

727
01:05:10.633 --> 01:05:13.063
You need special clearance
to get down there.

728
01:05:13.147 --> 01:05:14.147
Thirty minutes.

729
01:05:23.581 --> 01:05:25.449
Here. Take this.

730
01:05:27.784 --> 01:05:29.433
- You're ready?
- Yep.

731
01:05:39.483 --> 01:05:41.683
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

732
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:44.412
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

733
01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:48.010
Claire should never have hidden you away.

734
01:05:48.094 --> 01:05:50.490
You're way too important, maisie.

735
01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.410
You took her too?

736
01:05:57.409 --> 01:05:58.409
Yeah.

737
01:05:59.338 --> 01:06:01.780
We needed her to help us understand you.

738
01:06:06.803 --> 01:06:08.150
Hey, beta.

739
01:06:10.205 --> 01:06:11.488
You okay?

740
01:06:11.572 --> 01:06:14.307
Did you say beta? Is that her name?

741
01:06:15.194 --> 01:06:16.583
I gave it to her.

742
01:06:17.196 --> 01:06:18.435
Beta's pretty special.

743
01:06:18.963 --> 01:06:21.771
When we made blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA

744
01:06:21.869 --> 01:06:23.538
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

745
01:06:24.467 --> 01:06:27.212
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

746
01:06:27.593 --> 01:06:31.431
So, beta and blue
are genetically identical.

747
01:06:31.535 --> 01:06:33.668
And that's what they have
in common with you and...

748
01:06:33.769 --> 01:06:34.769
Charlotte.

749
01:06:37.786 --> 01:06:39.444
What do you know about Charlotte?

750
01:06:39.905 --> 01:06:41.065
She died.

751
01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.535
A long time ago.

752
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:46.207
It broke my grandpa's heart.

753
01:06:48.189 --> 01:06:49.911
So, he made me.

754
01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:53.312
No, maisie, actually he didn't.

755
01:06:55.889 --> 01:06:57.632
Charlotte made you.

756
01:07:00.657 --> 01:07:04.225
<i>I'm so excited that everyone see
what we've been doing here.</i>

757
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:08.497
<i>There's new technology being made,
new science, like every day almost.</i>

758
01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:13.023
<i>And it's great to be
in the center of that.</i>

759
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:19.352
Charlotte lived on site b
with all of us till the storm.

760
01:07:20.729 --> 01:07:22.284
She'd loved dinosaurs.

761
01:07:22.492 --> 01:07:23.902
<i>Charlotte, be careful.</i>

762
01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:24.840
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

763
01:07:24.924 --> 01:07:26.669
She grew up around scientists.

764
01:07:27.923 --> 01:07:29.164
And eventually...

765
01:07:30.973 --> 01:07:32.511
She became one herself.

766
01:07:32.595 --> 01:07:34.681
<i>A butterfly flew into my office
this morning.</i>

767
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:38.698
<i>They say tiny things have huge impacts,
and I agree, wholeheartedly.</i>

768
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:40.885
She was brilliant.

769
01:07:43.068 --> 01:07:44.531
In ways that I'll never be.

770
01:07:44.963 --> 01:07:48.533
<i>In a metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?</i>

771
01:07:49.186 --> 01:07:50.344
<i>And if it's possible,</i>

772
01:07:51.305 --> 01:07:52.634
<i>what makes it so?</i>

773
01:07:57.621 --> 01:07:59.183
<i>I've lost my pen.</i>

774
01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:04.452
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

775
01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:09.903
Just like blue Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

776
01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:14.641
She created you with her own DNA.

777
01:08:15.939 --> 01:08:17.057
So, I do have a mother.

778
01:08:18.112 --> 01:08:20.661
Your grandfather didn't want anyone
to know the truth.

779
01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:22.679
He was protecting her.

780
01:08:23.345 --> 01:08:24.346
And you.

781
01:08:25.323 --> 01:08:26.395
Are we the same?

782
01:08:28.506 --> 01:08:29.520
You were.

783
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:34.294
When you were a baby Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

784
01:08:34.929 --> 01:08:36.232
That's how she died.

785
01:08:36.886 --> 01:08:39.100
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

786
01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.430
- Do I have it too?
- No.

787
01:08:43.678 --> 01:08:45.595
She changed your DNA.

788
01:08:46.377 --> 01:08:50.604
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

789
01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:54.073
No one on earth has ever known
how to do that.

790
01:08:54.562 --> 01:08:55.612
She fixed me.

791
01:08:56.219 --> 01:08:59.055
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

792
01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:03.705
Your DNA could change the world.

793
01:09:04.429 --> 01:09:06.840
And I have to know how she did it.

794
01:09:06.924 --> 01:09:08.716
But I just can't replicate her work.

795
01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:10.518
If I could just study you

796
01:09:10.602 --> 01:09:13.858
and beta whose DNA
was never changed I could...

797
01:09:16.292 --> 01:09:18.975
Fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

798
01:09:19.716 --> 01:09:21.031
What's kind of mistake?

799
01:09:29.417 --> 01:09:31.635
<i>Sub-level 6. Restricted.</i>

800
01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:37.925
Thanks for coming.

801
01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:44.411
Which lab did Malcolm say?

802
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:45.510
L4.

803
01:09:50.517 --> 01:09:51.537
This is it.

804
01:10:10.944 --> 01:10:14.679
Okay, get in, get the sample, and get out.

805
01:10:14.762 --> 01:10:18.052
And move slow. They could swarm
at even the slightest disturbance.

806
01:10:43.476 --> 01:10:44.901
Orthoptera.

807
01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.311
Who weeks.

808
01:10:51.968 --> 01:10:54.696
Fully mature. This one.

809
01:10:57.168 --> 01:10:59.390
Ready? Easy.

810
01:11:03.442 --> 01:11:05.745
Okay, go.

811
01:11:07.724 --> 01:11:08.805
What?

812
01:11:09.753 --> 01:11:11.001
Go get it.

813
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.430
I that necessary?

814
01:11:15.144 --> 01:11:16.800
What did you think was gonna happen?

815
01:11:16.884 --> 01:11:20.278
I have to take a sample.
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

816
01:11:20.362 --> 01:11:22.338
Alan, you said there was no time.

817
01:11:22.422 --> 01:11:23.828
Can you get it?

818
01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.280
Of course I can get it.

819
01:11:26.698 --> 01:11:27.872
Easy.

820
01:11:30.193 --> 01:11:31.334
Watch its legs.

821
01:11:35.047 --> 01:11:36.047
Here we go.

822
01:11:37.986 --> 01:11:39.507
They're still signaling between them.

823
01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:41.396
- This is not good, Ellen.
- Almost got it.

824
01:11:44.435 --> 01:11:48.187
How does she remain an asset, Henry,
if you're incriminating both of us

825
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.771
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

826
01:11:50.855 --> 01:11:53.878
<i>Charlotte lockwood believed the methods
we used at Jurassic park</i>

827
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:55.362
<i>could cure diseases.</i>

828
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:56.946
<i>She was right.</i>

829
01:11:57.431 --> 01:12:00.856
<i>Having filled the gaps in maisie's genome
with altered DNA,</i>

830
01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.067
<i>she used a pathogen to deliver
the repaired sequence to every cell.</i>

831
01:12:05.728 --> 01:12:09.759
<i>If I can re-purpose what she did,
I could change the locusts DNA,</i>

832
01:12:09.843 --> 01:12:12.379
<i>eradicating them in a single generation.</i>

833
01:12:12.473 --> 01:12:15.549
<i>Maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.</i>

834
01:12:23.313 --> 01:12:25.073
Hey, you wanna get out of that?

835
01:12:28.967 --> 01:12:30.095
What the...?

836
01:12:31.788 --> 01:12:32.788
Got it.

837
01:12:57.769 --> 01:12:58.944
Maisie!

838
01:13:11.163 --> 01:13:14.183
<i>Asset containment breach.
Please remain in your sessions.</i>

839
01:13:16.303 --> 01:13:18.950
<i>Asset containment breach.
Please remain in your sessions.</i>

840
01:13:23.818 --> 01:13:25.019
Where's the key?

841
01:13:43.468 --> 01:13:44.468
You okay?

842
01:13:45.164 --> 01:13:47.299
Yeah, you?

843
01:13:48.153 --> 01:13:49.153
Yeah.

844
01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:02.801
You are Dr. Ellie sattler and Alan Grant.

845
01:14:03.474 --> 01:14:04.983
You were at Jurassic park.

846
01:14:06.217 --> 01:14:08.055
What are you doing here?

847
01:14:10.394 --> 01:14:11.702
What are you doing here?

848
01:14:14.063 --> 01:14:15.720
My name is maisie lockwood.

849
01:14:17.038 --> 01:14:19.238
My grandpa knew John Hammond.

850
01:14:25.778 --> 01:14:26.812
Hey.

851
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.857
We don't...

852
01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.105
We don't work for biosyn.

853
01:14:31.587 --> 01:14:32.810
I can tell.

854
01:14:33.063 --> 01:14:35.018
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we should go.

855
01:14:51.216 --> 01:14:53.911
Okay, in and out.
We find your girl and go.

856
01:14:55.205 --> 01:14:58.378
Tower, this n141, request to land
for freight delivery, over.

857
01:14:58.664 --> 01:14:59.850
N141, negative,

858
01:14:59.934 --> 01:15:03.256
we've been advised you're carrying
unauthorized passengers, over.

859
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.620
<i>Copy that, tower, be advised,
shipment is perishable.</i>

860
01:15:06.704 --> 01:15:09.021
<i>We need immediate clearance.
It's an emergency, over.</i>

861
01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.456
But we said "no."

862
01:15:11.311 --> 01:15:13.519
Negative, return to point of origin.

863
01:15:13.603 --> 01:15:16.208
You seem to be breaking up.
Are you hearing me on your side?

864
01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:20.710
Nice try, Kayla. They will down your bird.

865
01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.136
Who is this? Is this Denise?

866
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.348
<i>You do not want me
to start spilling secrets, Denise.</i>

867
01:15:26.432 --> 01:15:28.054
<i>You remember Dubrovnik?</i>

868
01:15:30.444 --> 01:15:34.108
It's a different Denise. In accounts.

869
01:15:41.825 --> 01:15:43.062
Talked to Santos.

870
01:15:43.749 --> 01:15:45.111
It's the girl's parents.

871
01:15:48.006 --> 01:15:49.883
Shut off the ads.

872
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.263
You sure?

873
01:16:00.506 --> 01:16:01.854
What's that?

874
01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:05.431
That's the aerial deterrent system.

875
01:16:05.632 --> 01:16:07.027
Keeps the airborne life away.

876
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:08.151
Why is it blinking?

877
01:16:08.235 --> 01:16:10.414
Because dead ass Denise
in the tower just turned it off.

878
01:16:10.438 --> 01:16:12.221
We gotta get out
of this airspace right now.

879
01:16:16.938 --> 01:16:18.468
That's another plane, right?

880
01:16:18.552 --> 01:16:19.733
Not exactly.

881
01:16:23.436 --> 01:16:25.566
- Is that a...?
- Quetzalcoatlus.

882
01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.909
Late cretaceous, should've stayed there.

883
01:16:34.571 --> 01:16:36.656
Okay, okay.

884
01:16:37.337 --> 01:16:38.959
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

885
01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:58.099
This plane in going down.

886
01:16:58.183 --> 01:17:00.828
If you're gonna eject
you need to do it now.

887
01:17:00.912 --> 01:17:02.770
I only got one chair, she's in it.

888
01:17:02.858 --> 01:17:06.005
- You don't have parachutes?
- I wasn't expecting company.

889
01:17:13.807 --> 01:17:16.543
Claire, we gotta get you off this plane.

890
01:17:16.627 --> 01:17:17.481
What?

891
01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:19.622
The parachute is gonna open automatically.

892
01:17:19.706 --> 01:17:22.465
If it doesn't you pull this lever.
Do you understand me?

893
01:17:22.549 --> 01:17:24.954
Claire! If it doesn't open automatically

894
01:17:25.038 --> 01:17:27.104
you gotta pull this lever here
behind you, okay?

895
01:17:27.188 --> 01:17:28.533
Ten thousand feet!

896
01:17:28.617 --> 01:17:30.716
Hey! You're the one
who's gotta go get to her.

897
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.882
You're her mom. You're her only shot.

898
01:17:35.867 --> 01:17:37.129
I'll see you again.

899
01:17:38.924 --> 01:17:40.062
I love you.

900
01:18:29.825 --> 01:18:30.870
What's the plan?

901
01:18:30.954 --> 01:18:33.672
Whatever happens - that's the plan.

902
01:18:48.219 --> 01:18:49.219
Three.

903
01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:51.895
Alan, we need the code.

904
01:18:51.979 --> 01:18:53.147
Let's try this thing.

905
01:18:53.374 --> 01:18:54.374
Yeah.

906
01:18:54.934 --> 01:18:56.281
Get down.

907
01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:03.541
Thank god, it's you.

908
01:19:04.236 --> 01:19:06.036
This place is such a maze.

909
01:19:06.121 --> 01:19:08.333
We were so confused.
I thought we were straight up lost.

910
01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:10.698
Then you said station 3.
And I was like, we thought...

911
01:19:10.782 --> 01:19:11.977
Do you have the sample?

912
01:19:12.512 --> 01:19:13.952
- What?
- What are you talking about?

913
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.608
The DNA sample, do you have it?

914
01:19:16.269 --> 01:19:18.308
Biosyn's responsible
for the locusts epidemic.

915
01:19:18.392 --> 01:19:19.399
Dodgson's covering it up.

916
01:19:19.483 --> 01:19:21.522
You were right. I'm here to help you.

917
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:23.493
Do you have it?

918
01:19:25.892 --> 01:19:26.892
Good.

919
01:19:27.243 --> 01:19:29.169
This pod will take you
straight to the airfield.

920
01:19:29.253 --> 01:19:30.496
We have a plane ready to fly.

921
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:32.682
Ian told you about hexapod allies?

922
01:19:32.766 --> 01:19:34.475
No, I told him.

923
01:19:34.559 --> 01:19:35.559
What?

924
01:19:36.489 --> 01:19:38.180
- Okay, guys, gotta go.
- Wait.

925
01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:44.503
Maisie.

926
01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:48.706
Maisie lockwood.

927
01:19:51.986 --> 01:19:52.986
Go.

928
01:24:07.865 --> 01:24:09.420
That was my baby.

929
01:24:18.001 --> 01:24:19.248
Where'd you learn to fly?

930
01:24:20.596 --> 01:24:21.871
Air force.

931
01:24:22.059 --> 01:24:23.699
Legacy on my mama side.

932
01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.326
I'm Navy.

933
01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:27.610
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

934
01:24:28.261 --> 01:24:30.410
I was a legit contract pilot for a grip,

935
01:24:30.494 --> 01:24:33.067
but didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home, ♪♪

936
01:24:33.091 --> 01:24:35.638
So I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

937
01:24:37.767 --> 01:24:40.191
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

938
01:24:40.525 --> 01:24:41.926
Is that why you're helping us?

939
01:24:45.198 --> 01:24:47.613
I was there when they handed
your girl off to biosyn.

940
01:24:49.274 --> 01:24:52.486
I could've said something, but I didn't.

941
01:24:52.803 --> 01:24:54.234
And when I saw her picture...

942
01:24:57.077 --> 01:24:59.773
It isn't enough to do nothing.

943
01:25:04.284 --> 01:25:05.287
Thank you.

944
01:25:52.286 --> 01:25:53.528
No.

945
01:25:58.094 --> 01:25:59.094
Nope.

946
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:24.670
What an asshole.

947
01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:17.106
You good?

948
01:27:17.785 --> 01:27:19.356
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

949
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.735
I'm not shook at all. Are you?

950
01:27:21.362 --> 01:27:22.362
No. No.

951
01:27:24.932 --> 01:27:27.281
Ejection seat beacon. We'll find her.

952
01:27:27.395 --> 01:27:28.724
Okay. Okay.

953
01:27:29.389 --> 01:27:30.989
You really love her, huh?

954
01:27:32.725 --> 01:27:33.725
Yeah.

955
01:27:34.463 --> 01:27:35.463
I get it.

956
01:27:36.956 --> 01:27:38.537
I like redheads too.

957
01:27:39.967 --> 01:27:41.249
What? God.

958
01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:47.912
- Who is that?
- That's Grant and sattler.

959
01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:50.212
- Is this live?
- Twelve minutes ago.

960
01:27:50.296 --> 01:27:52.909
We were tracking the escaped asset.
My guys missed it.

961
01:27:53.623 --> 01:27:55.391
They stole a DNA sample.

962
01:27:55.845 --> 01:27:58.240
- How did they get in there?
- They used an access key.

963
01:27:58.324 --> 01:27:59.603
Yankee white clearance.

964
01:28:00.951 --> 01:28:04.393
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm
put something in sattler's pocket.

965
01:28:06.617 --> 01:28:08.501
All right. I wanna see him.

966
01:28:08.586 --> 01:28:10.290
And get ramsay up here too, will you?

967
01:28:11.838 --> 01:28:12.838
Where are they now?

968
01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:14.473
On the way to the airfield.

969
01:28:14.557 --> 01:28:16.505
They caught a hyperloop right on schedule.

970
01:28:22.683 --> 01:28:23.765
How are you?

971
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:26.291
You all right?

972
01:28:27.695 --> 01:28:29.343
Not really, no.

973
01:28:31.328 --> 01:28:32.328
Hey.

974
01:28:33.096 --> 01:28:35.347
I knew your mom.

975
01:28:39.525 --> 01:28:41.088
You did?

976
01:28:43.013 --> 01:28:45.948
Yeah, few years after Hammond died

977
01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:49.407
she came to my university to lecture.

978
01:28:51.107 --> 01:28:52.467
And we became good friends.

979
01:28:53.075 --> 01:28:54.472
What was she like?

980
01:28:54.989 --> 01:28:56.127
Brilliant.

981
01:28:56.218 --> 01:28:58.114
Light-years ahead of everybody else.

982
01:28:59.445 --> 01:29:00.934
And she had a consciousness.

983
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:04.259
When they were building theme parks

984
01:29:04.376 --> 01:29:07.690
she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives.

985
01:29:09.157 --> 01:29:11.662
- And I was her experiment?
- No.

986
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:16.358
She wanted a child more than anything.

987
01:29:17.453 --> 01:29:20.045
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't,

988
01:29:21.569 --> 01:29:22.569
a full life.

989
01:29:25.896 --> 01:29:27.615
I didn't know her long,

990
01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.611
but I know she loved you very much.

991
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.605
What's happening?

992
01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.780
This must be the old Amber mines.

993
01:30:01.406 --> 01:30:04.398
They must've made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

994
01:30:29.836 --> 01:30:31.006
Hey.

995
01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:32.690
I heard the alarm. Everything all right?

996
01:30:32.763 --> 01:30:35.471
Yeah, nothing we can't handle.

997
01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:36.577
Listen...

998
01:30:36.661 --> 01:30:37.498
You rang?

999
01:30:37.582 --> 01:30:39.739
Oh, good, Dr. Malcolm, you are

1000
01:30:40.672 --> 01:30:41.687
fired.

1001
01:30:42.459 --> 01:30:43.562
What?

1002
01:30:43.646 --> 01:30:46.566
It was such a cushy gig.

1003
01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:50.585
You can give your access key
to security if you still have it.

1004
01:30:50.668 --> 01:30:53.534
One of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the Amber mines.

1005
01:30:53.618 --> 01:30:54.618
What?

1006
01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:57.580
Wow, this day.

1007
01:30:58.099 --> 01:30:59.583
Which pod?

1008
01:30:59.667 --> 01:31:00.667
Are there...

1009
01:31:02.094 --> 01:31:03.585
Dinosaurs in the mines?

1010
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:05.293
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1011
01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:07.596
Technically birds are dinosaurs,
genetically speaking.

1012
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:11.290
Lewis, Grant and sattler are on this pod.
We need to send a security team out there.

1013
01:31:11.374 --> 01:31:13.137
Okay, absolutely, ramsay, thank you.

1014
01:31:13.221 --> 01:31:14.912
Let's all just stay in our lanes though.

1015
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.598
We can take care of it.
Thank you, doctor.

1016
01:31:17.682 --> 01:31:20.209
That's it, huh? Nothing else to see here?

1017
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:24.100
I'm not sure I admire your tone right now.

1018
01:31:24.207 --> 01:31:25.668
- You need to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

1019
01:31:25.752 --> 01:31:27.205
But first...

1020
01:31:27.289 --> 01:31:29.152
I owe all these folks an apology.

1021
01:31:29.236 --> 01:31:32.001
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint

1022
01:31:32.085 --> 01:31:34.983
I might have made it seem
as if biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1023
01:31:35.067 --> 01:31:37.252
- That's enough, Ian.
- See, that's how they get ya.

1024
01:31:37.338 --> 01:31:39.830
They give you so many promotions
in the short period of time.

1025
01:31:39.914 --> 01:31:42.070
That it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1026
01:31:42.154 --> 01:31:42.988
Oh, my god.

1027
01:31:43.072 --> 01:31:45.110
So, then there are doors
that you don't open.

1028
01:31:45.194 --> 01:31:46.387
Things that you ignore.

1029
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:49.935
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment

1030
01:31:50.963 --> 01:31:51.815
with these.

1031
01:31:51.899 --> 01:31:54.217
Is there an actual concern here?
Or you just...

1032
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:56.917
You are racing toward the extinction
of our species,

1033
01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.328
and you don't care.

1034
01:31:58.412 --> 01:32:01.569
You know exactly what you're doing.
But you won't stop.

1035
01:32:01.653 --> 01:32:02.653
You can't.

1036
01:32:03.231 --> 01:32:06.384
I thought you might be different,
but you just like everyone else.

1037
01:32:06.468 --> 01:32:07.571
You see what you wanna see.

1038
01:32:07.959 --> 01:32:12.245
You imagine unchecked avarice,
so that's what you find.

1039
01:32:12.329 --> 01:32:17.191
You envision what, an evil unbound
prometheus, so that what I am to you?

1040
01:32:17.275 --> 01:32:18.765
Prometheus got gored.

1041
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:21.681
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.

1042
01:32:21.765 --> 01:32:25.563
Ramsay, would you help
Dr. Malcolm gather his things?

1043
01:32:26.498 --> 01:32:28.660
His room and then to the airfield.
That's it.

1044
01:32:38.693 --> 01:32:39.787
Dodgson.

1045
01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.931
Allosaurus?

1046
01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:17.562
Giganotosaurus.

1047
01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:20.125
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.

1048
01:34:20.929 --> 01:34:23.247
He put two apex predators in one valley.

1049
01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:25.172
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.

1050
01:34:57.434 --> 01:34:58.598
Did you feel that?

1051
01:35:00.418 --> 01:35:01.823
That's an air current.

1052
01:35:02.351 --> 01:35:03.819
Must be an opening up ahead.

1053
01:35:05.249 --> 01:35:06.848
How old is this mine do you think?

1054
01:35:07.558 --> 01:35:08.686
Just breathe.

1055
01:35:09.474 --> 01:35:11.527
Nobody panic. Just watch out for bats.

1056
01:35:11.617 --> 01:35:13.417
- Who said anything about bats?
- I hate bats.

1057
01:35:13.523 --> 01:35:15.967
There's probably no bats.
No falling rocks.

1058
01:35:16.849 --> 01:35:19.793
Just a possibility of toxic gas,
dehydration, hypothermia.

1059
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.147
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.

1060
01:35:22.231 --> 01:35:25.188
I should've left you where you were.
Why did I bring you into this?

1061
01:35:25.272 --> 01:35:26.786
You were happy in your element.

1062
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:27.704
What?

1063
01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.066
- Ellie.
- What?

1064
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.200
I wasn't happy.

1065
01:35:32.979 --> 01:35:33.863
You weren't?

1066
01:35:33.947 --> 01:35:35.162
Do you have kids?

1067
01:35:35.694 --> 01:35:36.694
What?

1068
01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:40.271
No. I do. Two.

1069
01:35:41.171 --> 01:35:42.232
But not with him?

1070
01:35:45.610 --> 01:35:46.646
No.

1071
01:35:47.387 --> 01:35:49.651
No, just old friends.

1072
01:35:50.192 --> 01:35:52.161
Yeah, just old friends.

1073
01:35:53.382 --> 01:35:54.382
Really?

1074
01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:01.478
Won't be long
before security knows you're gone.

1075
01:36:02.233 --> 01:36:05.188
Oh, map. That looks like an old map.
Do you have a new map?

1076
01:36:05.272 --> 01:36:07.770
There's an access gate
to the north-east corner of the mine.

1077
01:36:07.854 --> 01:36:09.372
- If your friends make it out.
- If?

1078
01:36:09.965 --> 01:36:12.075
When they make it out,
that's where they'll be.

1079
01:36:13.321 --> 01:36:15.155
These roads are protected, right?

1080
01:36:15.955 --> 01:36:17.023
Yeah, drive fast.

1081
01:36:28.664 --> 01:36:29.761
You did good.

1082
01:36:30.273 --> 01:36:33.372
Yeah, well... actually,
it's a complete disaster, but thanks.

1083
01:36:34.367 --> 01:36:35.367
Not yet.

1084
01:36:46.645 --> 01:36:47.679
Watch yourself.

1085
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:08.518
- Ellie.
- Yeah.

1086
01:37:13.873 --> 01:37:14.873
What was that?

1087
01:37:22.258 --> 01:37:23.259
Careful.

1088
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.268
- Oh, my god!
- Are you okay?

1089
01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:59.141
Forget the hat!

1090
01:38:01.198 --> 01:38:02.198
Come on!

1091
01:38:11.794 --> 01:38:12.862
Go, go!

1092
01:38:18.646 --> 01:38:19.980
It's a car.

1093
01:38:21.704 --> 01:38:23.501
- God, Ian!
- In here! Over here.

1094
01:38:24.796 --> 01:38:25.833
- In here!
- Come on, Ian!

1095
01:38:25.917 --> 01:38:27.859
- Open the gate!
- Please help us.

1096
01:38:28.707 --> 01:38:29.936
Do you know the code?

1097
01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.745
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1098
01:38:32.739 --> 01:38:34.581
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1099
01:38:35.508 --> 01:38:37.124
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1100
01:38:38.725 --> 01:38:40.563
The brake, pull the break!

1101
01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:41.808
There's 10,000 possibilities.

1102
01:38:41.883 --> 01:38:43.266
Push with your legs! That's it.

1103
01:38:44.908 --> 01:38:47.366
- 1984.
- Come on, Ian!

1104
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:49.906
- Here come again!
- Hurry!

1105
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:53.063
Miles Davis' birthday, 0526.

1106
01:38:58.376 --> 01:39:00.909
- Ian, do something!
- Please, please!

1107
01:39:00.993 --> 01:39:02.260
We're not gonna make it.

1108
01:39:02.344 --> 01:39:04.301
Let's all try and stay positive.

1109
01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:23.673
- Please.
- I know. I know.

1110
01:39:30.296 --> 01:39:31.356
Oh, my god!

1111
01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:35.092
What do you know,
it actually worked.

1112
01:39:41.054 --> 01:39:43.315
- Ian, this is maisie.
- Hi, maisie.

1113
01:39:43.881 --> 01:39:45.423
We got the DNA.

1114
01:39:46.667 --> 01:39:48.181
We need to get out of this valley.

1115
01:39:48.265 --> 01:39:50.385
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on.

1116
01:40:21.703 --> 01:40:23.236
Come on, come on.

1117
01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:34.501
Go on! Get.

1118
01:41:37.903 --> 01:41:38.830
Hey.

1119
01:41:38.914 --> 01:41:39.914
Oh, my god.

1120
01:41:41.684 --> 01:41:42.979
I thought you were dead.

1121
01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.220
What do they even eat?

1122
01:41:49.432 --> 01:41:50.933
We better get inside.

1123
01:42:05.206 --> 01:42:06.435
Locust plague jumps continents

1124
01:42:06.519 --> 01:42:07.716
where did they come from?

1125
01:42:32.011 --> 01:42:33.364
Go ahead.

1126
01:43:12.723 --> 01:43:14.571
<i>Containment chamber is compromised.</i>

1127
01:43:30.659 --> 01:43:31.789
It's locked.

1128
01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.205
That'll need something heavy,
something sharp, or both.

1129
01:43:45.965 --> 01:43:48.436
That can't be right.

1130
01:44:00.458 --> 01:44:02.053
- Is that...?
- Oh, no.

1131
01:44:02.453 --> 01:44:03.748
Oh, my god.

1132
01:44:06.383 --> 01:44:07.843
He's burning the evidence.

1133
01:44:09.031 --> 01:44:10.518
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

1134
01:44:10.603 --> 01:44:11.960
That's bananas.

1135
01:44:28.466 --> 01:44:29.507
Yeah.

1136
01:44:30.131 --> 01:44:31.134
Oh, my god.

1137
01:44:31.663 --> 01:44:35.546
I know how this may seem
precarious, but...

1138
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:39.132
No, we're teetering.

1139
01:44:41.337 --> 01:44:43.674
Should we all
lean to the left or something?

1140
01:44:43.758 --> 01:44:45.680
That's a very constructive.
Thank you, maisie.

1141
01:44:47.313 --> 01:44:49.242
Slow. Slow.

1142
01:44:51.496 --> 01:44:52.497
Slow.

1143
01:44:56.606 --> 01:44:57.662
We're fine.

1144
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:59.417
See this?

1145
01:45:00.339 --> 01:45:01.554
This is fine.

1146
01:45:15.836 --> 01:45:18.164
Alan? Alan!

1147
01:45:19.566 --> 01:45:20.714
How's everybody?

1148
01:45:31.067 --> 01:45:34.664
It's my parents! Help!

1149
01:45:35.375 --> 01:45:36.407
Help!

1150
01:45:36.498 --> 01:45:37.498
Listen.

1151
01:45:45.379 --> 01:45:46.443
Oh, my god!

1152
01:45:47.170 --> 01:45:48.347
You're okay.

1153
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:50.481
You're okay.

1154
01:45:50.957 --> 01:45:53.663
You came to get me.
You actually came to get me.

1155
01:45:53.909 --> 01:45:56.121
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1156
01:45:56.205 --> 01:45:58.060
- Hey, kiddo.
- Of course.

1157
01:46:00.034 --> 01:46:01.548
I remember you.

1158
01:46:03.176 --> 01:46:04.538
I remember you too.

1159
01:46:15.378 --> 01:46:16.747
They helped me escape.

1160
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:23.484
You okay?

1161
01:46:26.289 --> 01:46:27.557
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1162
01:46:30.352 --> 01:46:31.767
We gotta go.

1163
01:46:32.475 --> 01:46:34.849
Gonna have to break the window
to get inside that thing.

1164
01:46:35.817 --> 01:46:37.574
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.

1165
01:46:50.576 --> 01:46:52.595
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

1166
01:47:10.846 --> 01:47:12.113
What is that?

1167
01:47:12.795 --> 01:47:14.449
Giganotosaurus.

1168
01:47:16.633 --> 01:47:18.604
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.

1169
01:47:31.584 --> 01:47:32.584
Come on.

1170
01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:39.881
Maisie, look at me. Look at me.

1171
01:48:03.622 --> 01:48:04.622
Move.

1172
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:21.873
- Go, go.
- Come on!

1173
01:48:27.741 --> 01:48:28.811
No, no!

1174
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:35.239
- Hustle.
- I'm gonna die!

1175
01:48:35.577 --> 01:48:36.694
Climb. Climb, kid.

1176
01:48:36.778 --> 01:48:38.702
You're not. No, you're not. You're okay.

1177
01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.988
Go, go!

1178
01:49:06.829 --> 01:49:08.118
Come on.

1179
01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.541
Hey!

1180
01:49:17.526 --> 01:49:19.061
Oh, yeah, come here.

1181
01:49:36.795 --> 01:49:37.795
Hit me up.

1182
01:49:43.266 --> 01:49:44.288
I got ya.

1183
01:49:47.085 --> 01:49:48.326
Go, go!

1184
01:49:51.903 --> 01:49:52.903
Run!

1185
01:50:09.152 --> 01:50:10.948
See, not so bad.

1186
01:50:17.602 --> 01:50:18.602
Come on.

1187
01:50:20.998 --> 01:50:22.073
Claire!

1188
01:51:04.805 --> 01:51:06.280
Call in evacuation.

1189
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:07.978
We need to bring the animals inside.

1190
01:51:08.062 --> 01:51:10.988
The regulations are clear
that in the event of a level...

1191
01:51:14.111 --> 01:51:15.111
Jeffrey.

1192
01:51:20.489 --> 01:51:22.982
Goddamn it!

1193
01:51:25.786 --> 01:51:26.786
Just...

1194
01:51:28.369 --> 01:51:29.457
Just call it.

1195
01:51:30.265 --> 01:51:33.935
Attention! Attention!
This is an immediate evacuation order.

1196
01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.933
Remote herding system is now active.

1197
01:51:36.051 --> 01:51:39.550
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1198
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:06.394
I can't get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire.

1199
01:52:06.891 --> 01:52:09.258
- Dr. Sattler, get some water.
- Thanks.

1200
01:52:09.342 --> 01:52:11.557
Dr. Grant, yours.

1201
01:52:11.641 --> 01:52:13.129
I'm Owen Grady.

1202
01:52:13.213 --> 01:52:16.547
Big fan, I've read your book.
Well, book on tape.

1203
01:52:16.634 --> 01:52:18.964
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.

1204
01:52:19.049 --> 01:52:20.436
Yeah, I know who you are.

1205
01:52:21.244 --> 01:52:23.477
You trained raptors.

1206
01:52:24.021 --> 01:52:25.836
I tried. Yeah.

1207
01:52:26.191 --> 01:52:28.843
- How are you doing?
- One here.

1208
01:52:29.423 --> 01:52:31.820
You were at Jurassic world.

1209
01:52:31.904 --> 01:52:33.169
Jurassic world?

1210
01:52:33.516 --> 01:52:34.663
Not a fan.

1211
01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:39.562
Okay, so, we're good
to find a way outta here?

1212
01:52:39.653 --> 01:52:40.539
Yep.

1213
01:52:40.623 --> 01:52:42.013
Let's get it.

1214
01:52:42.098 --> 01:52:45.302
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1215
01:52:45.386 --> 01:52:47.939
We turn the ads back on, we go home.

1216
01:52:48.023 --> 01:52:49.492
Wait, what's an ads?

1217
01:52:49.625 --> 01:52:50.933
Aerial deterrent system.

1218
01:52:52.348 --> 01:52:56.288
You know, for the pterodactyls and shit.
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1219
01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:58.536
How do we turn it back on?

1220
01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:01.356
Okay, it looks like all the systems
run through the control room

1221
01:53:01.463 --> 01:53:02.800
which is on the third floor,

1222
01:53:04.222 --> 01:53:06.496
and these outposts
are all connected underground.

1223
01:53:12.017 --> 01:53:13.034
All right, easy, Rambo.

1224
01:53:23.966 --> 01:53:26.023
So, you worked in the raptor pan, huh?

1225
01:53:26.691 --> 01:53:27.896
Yeah.

1226
01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:32.849
Wow, and what happens, you just tell them
what to do and they comply or...

1227
01:53:33.977 --> 01:53:37.672
Well, that's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1228
01:53:40.139 --> 01:53:41.560
I had a dog once.

1229
01:53:42.528 --> 01:53:46.806
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1230
01:53:47.403 --> 01:53:48.617
It's a true story.

1231
01:54:01.907 --> 01:54:03.403
Oh, god. Hey.

1232
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:04.790
Good.

1233
01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:07.813
Here's what I'm thinking.

1234
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:09.941
We get started again, you and me.

1235
01:54:10.356 --> 01:54:11.724
I can get money.

1236
01:54:13.079 --> 01:54:15.269
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1237
01:54:15.362 --> 01:54:17.685
What's the matter? Don't look so worried.

1238
01:54:18.531 --> 01:54:21.631
There's opportunity in everything,
even this.

1239
01:54:21.718 --> 01:54:23.349
You'll learn that.

1240
01:54:23.433 --> 01:54:24.550
I've been thinking...

1241
01:54:25.385 --> 01:54:27.534
Maybe you take more
of a lead now, okay?

1242
01:54:28.121 --> 01:54:29.243
You're ready I think.

1243
01:54:29.716 --> 01:54:31.258
Here. Take it.

1244
01:54:31.691 --> 01:54:33.387
What the hell is the matter with you?

1245
01:54:42.739 --> 01:54:43.936
It was you.

1246
01:54:44.571 --> 01:54:46.839
You told Malcolm about the program. You...

1247
01:54:48.052 --> 01:54:50.826
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up?

1248
01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.953
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1249
01:54:55.621 --> 01:54:57.984
We have an understanding, ramsay,

1250
01:54:58.605 --> 01:55:00.133
and you do not break that.

1251
01:55:03.007 --> 01:55:04.842
I would not break this.

1252
01:55:07.997 --> 01:55:08.997
I'm not you.

1253
01:55:24.445 --> 01:55:25.743
This is very bad.

1254
01:55:27.957 --> 01:55:30.244
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1255
01:55:30.328 --> 01:55:34.952
Great, so we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1256
01:55:35.036 --> 01:55:36.697
Let me see. Ads.

1257
01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:39.922
What's this? What's "error 99"?

1258
01:55:40.006 --> 01:55:41.040
Not enough power.

1259
01:55:41.878 --> 01:55:43.336
In a breakdown all available power

1260
01:55:43.427 --> 01:55:45.375
is seized by the primary system
to keep running.

1261
01:55:45.935 --> 01:55:48.032
We need all that power
to re-activate the ads.

1262
01:55:48.116 --> 01:55:50.902
So, the system safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1263
01:55:50.986 --> 01:55:51.853
Of course.

1264
01:55:51.937 --> 01:55:53.134
How do we get more power?

1265
01:55:53.218 --> 01:55:55.664
We can't. But we can re-distribute
what we have, if we just...

1266
01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:57.668
- Just need to...
- Shut down the primary system.

1267
01:55:57.737 --> 01:55:59.234
- Yes, exactly.
- Where is it?

1268
01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:01.203
- Next floor up.
- I'm coming with you.

1269
01:56:01.294 --> 01:56:02.551
We escaped down here.

1270
01:56:03.892 --> 01:56:05.412
Where is that? Water treatment center.

1271
01:56:05.475 --> 01:56:07.111
Hydroelectric system, sub 8.

1272
01:56:07.195 --> 01:56:08.934
Give me eight minutes, I could find her.

1273
01:56:09.018 --> 01:56:10.989
- Wait, who's this now?
- Beta.

1274
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:13.638
- Blue's baby.
- Velociraptor.

1275
01:56:14.171 --> 01:56:15.926
- What?
- A baby raptor?

1276
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:17.789
And you gave her a name, how about that.

1277
01:56:17.873 --> 01:56:19.518
I made a promise we would bring her home.

1278
01:56:19.602 --> 01:56:21.803
You made a promise to a dinosaur.

1279
01:56:22.623 --> 01:56:23.918
You're coming with us, right?

1280
01:56:24.738 --> 01:56:25.655
Maisie...

1281
01:56:25.739 --> 01:56:26.739
Please.

1282
01:56:30.154 --> 01:56:32.113
- We'll be on channel 5.
- Okay.

1283
01:56:32.197 --> 01:56:33.197
We're on 3.

1284
01:56:34.956 --> 01:56:35.956
Come back.

1285
01:56:36.674 --> 01:56:37.901
I always come back.

1286
01:56:39.319 --> 01:56:42.141
I'll have that chopper hot in ten,
wait for my signal.

1287
01:56:44.022 --> 01:56:48.519
<i>Evacuation phase four complete.
All living assets are now in containment.</i>

1288
01:56:57.434 --> 01:56:58.447
Come on.

1289
01:57:11.069 --> 01:57:12.363
Still get nightmares?

1290
01:57:13.073 --> 01:57:14.197
All of the time.

1291
01:57:15.104 --> 01:57:16.104
You?

1292
01:57:17.367 --> 01:57:18.768
I have a lot of regrets.

1293
01:57:19.483 --> 01:57:20.483
Oh, yeah?

1294
01:57:22.041 --> 01:57:23.041
Well...

1295
01:57:23.953 --> 01:57:26.909
We hold on to regret we stay in the past.

1296
01:57:30.609 --> 01:57:32.562
What matters, I guess, is...

1297
01:57:34.094 --> 01:57:36.504
Is what we do now, right?

1298
01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:38.259
Yeah.

1299
01:57:55.402 --> 01:57:57.242
Nobody said there'll be bugs.

1300
01:57:59.496 --> 01:58:01.598
B4. She's in here.

1301
01:58:02.285 --> 01:58:03.817
Watch the sides.

1302
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:06.072
They always come from the sides.

1303
01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:09.536
You know, at first we thought...

1304
01:58:11.289 --> 01:58:14.386
They disembowel their prey, but now...

1305
01:58:15.258 --> 01:58:17.560
They're smart enough
to go straight to the throat.

1306
01:58:18.729 --> 01:58:20.366
Veins, the arteries.

1307
01:58:21.523 --> 01:58:23.621
Sometimes both at the same time.

1308
01:58:23.715 --> 01:58:24.856
Okay.

1309
01:58:26.642 --> 01:58:27.799
Okay.

1310
01:58:27.883 --> 01:58:29.961
<i>We've got you. It's right down that isle.</i>

1311
01:58:30.045 --> 01:58:31.727
<i>It's right down that isle where you are.</i>

1312
01:58:32.798 --> 01:58:35.644
Why are they skulking?
You can sprint right for it.

1313
01:58:35.728 --> 01:58:37.561
Okay. Here it is.

1314
01:58:37.645 --> 01:58:40.128
Okay, it'll be a yellow button
on the grid of six.

1315
01:58:40.212 --> 01:58:42.952
<i>There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?</i>

1316
01:58:43.042 --> 01:58:46.016
It's not the green button,
it's fourth from the bottom.

1317
01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:47.460
Whoa, whoa...

1318
01:58:47.544 --> 01:58:48.407
Fourth one up?

1319
01:58:48.492 --> 01:58:50.212
Third one down or fourth one up.
Same thing.

1320
01:58:50.277 --> 01:58:51.681
Ian, be specific.

1321
01:58:56.726 --> 01:58:57.726
She was here.

1322
01:58:58.528 --> 01:58:59.576
Lights off.

1323
01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:08.606
I don't know how I could possibly
be more specific

1324
01:59:08.690 --> 01:59:13.104
other than to say that the one you want
is marked with e1.

1325
01:59:15.096 --> 01:59:16.096
- E1.
- Okay.

1326
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:17.830
Yeah.

1327
01:59:22.968 --> 01:59:25.176
No. No, no.

1328
01:59:31.726 --> 01:59:33.034
Dammit, she's fast.

1329
01:59:36.705 --> 01:59:37.705
Hey!

1330
01:59:38.761 --> 01:59:39.916
Eyes on me!

1331
01:59:44.349 --> 01:59:46.597
I've gotta hit her
on the side of the neck.

1332
01:59:46.681 --> 01:59:48.662
Maisie, you gonna hold her focused.

1333
01:59:49.173 --> 01:59:51.716
Grant, we're triangulating.

1334
01:59:58.225 --> 01:59:59.228
Go.

1335
02:00:28.499 --> 02:00:29.510
Sorry, girl.

1336
02:00:30.398 --> 02:00:32.067
I promised your mama I'd get you home.

1337
02:00:33.547 --> 02:00:35.792
<i>Primary system rebooting.</i>

1338
02:00:35.876 --> 02:00:38.317
Wait, no, no.

1339
02:00:38.401 --> 02:00:39.295
It's rebooting.

1340
02:00:39.379 --> 02:00:40.751
No, it shouldn't be doing that.

1341
02:00:52.156 --> 02:00:53.432
Here, come on, take this.

1342
02:01:09.618 --> 02:01:11.168
<i>Ian, shut it down!</i>

1343
02:01:11.252 --> 02:01:13.252
We're gonna make it work.
We gonna figure this out.

1344
02:01:13.308 --> 02:01:15.445
- It's very complex.
- We don't have time for complex!

1345
02:01:21.013 --> 02:01:22.715
<i>Primary system compromised.</i>

1346
02:01:25.234 --> 02:01:26.554
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1347
02:01:26.639 --> 02:01:28.584
<i>Aerial deterrent system activate.</i>

1348
02:01:28.668 --> 02:01:30.129
Victory. Victory.

1349
02:01:33.593 --> 02:01:34.606
Damn, that felt good.

1350
02:02:04.027 --> 02:02:05.260
Come on!

1351
02:02:57.833 --> 02:02:58.840
What's your story...

1352
02:03:14.531 --> 02:03:16.977
<i>At biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea</i>

1353
02:03:17.068 --> 02:03:20.745
<i>that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.</i>

1354
02:03:25.717 --> 02:03:28.299
<i>All right, Kayla, we're good to go.</i>

1355
02:03:38.607 --> 02:03:39.955
Okay, cutie.

1356
02:03:48.944 --> 02:03:51.119
- You all right?
- Someday.

1357
02:03:51.306 --> 02:03:52.394
Hey.

1358
02:04:00.252 --> 02:04:02.124
I remember you.

1359
02:04:02.208 --> 02:04:03.815
Please, you have to listen to me.

1360
02:04:03.899 --> 02:04:05.960
You created an ecological disaster.

1361
02:04:06.044 --> 02:04:07.249
And I can fix it.

1362
02:04:07.912 --> 02:04:11.184
Charlotte lockwood changed every cell
in maisie's body.

1363
02:04:12.272 --> 02:04:13.373
It saved her life.

1364
02:04:14.021 --> 02:04:17.227
If I can understand how Charlotte
rewrote maisie's DNA

1365
02:04:17.311 --> 02:04:20.717
I can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm

1366
02:04:20.822 --> 02:04:22.270
before it's too late.

1367
02:04:24.451 --> 02:04:26.644
It's okay. It's okay.

1368
02:04:30.813 --> 02:04:32.286
It's what she would've wanted.

1369
02:04:35.583 --> 02:04:36.687
Thank you.

1370
02:04:36.772 --> 02:04:37.980
No, no, no.

1371
02:04:38.968 --> 02:04:40.508
No, no.

1372
02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:45.024
Him? Not him. Not him. It's always him.

1373
02:04:45.805 --> 02:04:46.805
Every single...

1374
02:04:48.012 --> 02:04:49.941
Is that a dinosaur on your shoulder?

1375
02:04:50.744 --> 02:04:52.107
Yeah, why?

1376
02:04:53.735 --> 02:04:55.841
<i>I have air. Meet me in the center.</i>

1377
02:04:56.314 --> 02:04:57.415
Wait, wait. Hey.

1378
02:04:58.014 --> 02:04:59.450
Do not land in here.

1379
02:04:59.534 --> 02:05:01.587
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1380
02:05:01.671 --> 02:05:03.496
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1381
02:06:35.562 --> 02:06:36.565
This isn't about us.

1382
02:07:08.884 --> 02:07:10.447
Get up! Come on, come on!

1383
02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:11.580
Come on.

1384
02:07:15.128 --> 02:07:16.139
Come on! Come on!

1385
02:07:21.301 --> 02:07:22.408
Come on!

1386
02:07:36.636 --> 02:07:37.930
Ellie, no!

1387
02:08:06.994 --> 02:08:08.795
Go, maisie, go!

1388
02:08:10.324 --> 02:08:11.473
Ramsay, get on.

1389
02:08:11.557 --> 02:08:13.199
Come on, come on.

1390
02:08:18.108 --> 02:08:19.676
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1391
02:09:44.490 --> 02:09:46.272
No, at every level.

1392
02:09:46.356 --> 02:09:49.023
Complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks.

1393
02:09:49.108 --> 02:09:51.499
"Systemic corruption", you got that?
Write that down.

1394
02:09:52.847 --> 02:09:53.943
Yeah, okay.

1395
02:09:54.077 --> 02:09:57.678
And then we clashed
into this ice lake, right?

1396
02:09:57.762 --> 02:09:59.533
I mean they literally owe me a plane.

1397
02:09:59.943 --> 02:10:02.421
I need to get this sample vetted
at the lab

1398
02:10:02.788 --> 02:10:05.024
before I take it to my contract
at the times.

1399
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:09.511
You could a come with me.

1400
02:10:11.039 --> 02:10:13.757
Unless you need to get back to your dig.

1401
02:10:16.469 --> 02:10:18.139
- Ellie.
- Yeah?

1402
02:10:20.617 --> 02:10:22.307
I am coming with you.

1403
02:10:33.448 --> 02:10:34.295
I know.

1404
02:10:34.379 --> 02:10:36.864
One more minute, then we'll send you home
with your folks.

1405
02:11:16.514 --> 02:11:21.183
<i>Today marks the first day of testimony
from biosyn whistleblower ramsay Cole.</i>

1406
02:11:21.281 --> 02:11:24.989
<i>The senate will also hear

1407
02:11:25.073 --> 02:11:28.647
<i>who have been vocal on this debate
since the incident at Jurassic park.</i>

1408
02:11:31.405 --> 02:11:32.405
You look.

1409
02:11:33.155 --> 02:11:34.624
- Untrustable.
- Trustworthy.

1410
02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:42.317
Yeah, not getting used to it.

1411
02:11:44.578 --> 02:11:45.580
Let's finish this.

1412
02:11:46.517 --> 02:11:47.526
Yeah.

1413
02:11:51.721 --> 02:11:56.051
<i>Dr. Henry wu has found an emergency
solution to the ecological crisis.</i>

1414
02:11:56.666 --> 02:11:59.884
<i>His use of a pathogen
to alter the locusts' DNA</i>

1415
02:11:59.968 --> 02:12:02.069
<i>has revolutionized modern genetics.</i>

1416
02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:06.841
<i>He attributed the discovery
to another scientist, Charlotte lockwood,</i>

1417
02:12:06.925 --> 02:12:09.424
<i>who died nearly 13 years ago.</i>

1418
02:12:37.126 --> 02:12:42.044
<i>By UN decree biosyn valley
has been designated a global sanctuary.</i>

1419
02:12:42.128 --> 02:12:45.965
<i>The animals will live there free,
safe from the outside world.</i>

1420
02:12:50.545 --> 02:12:51.545
Money?

1421
02:12:51.913 --> 02:12:53.355
- Money.
- Thank you.

1422
02:14:57.104 --> 02:15:01.103
<i>Life on earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years.</i>

1423
02:15:02.164 --> 02:15:04.501
<i>And dinosaurs were only a part of that.</i>

1424
02:15:05.028 --> 02:15:07.223
<i>And we are an even smaller part of that.</i>

1425
02:15:07.843 --> 02:15:10.018
<i>They really put us in perspective.</i>

1426
02:15:11.898 --> 02:15:15.276
<i>The idea that life on earth
existed 65 million years ago,</i>

1427
02:15:17.024 --> 02:15:18.196
<i>it's humbling.</i>

1428
02:15:19.599 --> 02:15:21.648
<i>We act like we're along here
but we're not.</i>

1429
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:26.187
<i>We're a part of a fragile system
made up of all living things.</i>

1430
02:15:26.768 --> 02:15:29.898
<i>If we're going to survive
we'll have to trust each other.</i>

1431
02:15:31.018 --> 02:15:32.393
<i>Depend on each other.</i>

1432
02:15:33.635 --> 02:15:34.650
<i>Coexist.</i>
