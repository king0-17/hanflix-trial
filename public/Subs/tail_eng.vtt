00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:02.500
This program is rated G

2
00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

3
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.033
Good morning, Bella!

4
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.734
Morning, Nana.
How did you sleep?

5
00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.066
Just great, thank you.

6
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.567
Good, there's tea for you.

7
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.000
Oh, thank you.

8
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.467
And I'm going to go check on
the new recruits

9
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.467
and give them some food.

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.934
Okay. See you in a bit.

11
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.266
Sounds good.

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.967
Okay.

13
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.266
Where is...

14
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.867
Finnegan!

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.533
Come over here.

16
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.066
This one's for you.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Bella, would you like to say
goodbye to Cupcake?

18
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.200
She's going home with her new
family today.

19
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.567
Oh, yes, of course I would.

20
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Oh, Cupcake, we are going to
miss you.

21
00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.066
Good luck, guys.

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.333
Just give us a call if you need
anything, okay?

23
00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.066
I've gotta run, Maddie is back.

24
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.533
Okay, sure.
Here's your little Cupcake.

25
00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.100
Hey, Maddie.
What do we have here?

26
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.433
Hey, Bella. Special delivery.

27
00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.834
Oh, look at you, girl!
What's your name?

28
00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.400
Indie, as in Independence.

29
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.200
Aww. Hi, Indie!

30
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.734
I'm Bella. It's very nice
to meet you.

31
00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:44.100
Was she a police dog?

32
00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.533
Military, just came in
from Kandahar.

33
00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.533
Oh, well then you have training.

34
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:50.033
Okay, come on out.

35
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.266
Hey, hey.

36
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.266
Sit.

37
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.834
Good girl!
Do you want a cookie?

38
00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:59.000
All right,
let's go have some fun, huh?

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.300
Wow, she's got a lot of energy.

40
00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:04.734
Yeah, you think so?

41
00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:06.633
Bella:
Did she ever see combat?

42
00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.967
Yes, but her file's gone AWOL.
Still tracking it down.

43
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.567
Okay, here we go.

44
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.100
Will you get her settled?

45
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.567
I just have to organize
everything for the luncheon.

46
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100
Maddie: Yeah.
Okay.

47
00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:19.600
Bye, Indie. Nice to meet you.

48
00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:20.800
Okay, you stay here!

49
00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:22.133
Ready?

50
00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:40.834
- Hey!
- Hi!

51
00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.066
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay.

52
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.700
Smoothie emergency at
the juice bar.

53
00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:46.900
Oh no! Is everything okay?
Did the machine break down?

54
00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.600
Ran out of strawberries.

55
00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.967
Oh, well, everyone is absolutely
loving your juices.

56
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.834
Except for this little guy
right here.

57
00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:56.100
Well, sir, just so you know,

58
00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.033
the dog refreshment center
is right over there.

59
00:02:58.166 --> 00:02:59.967
Thanks, see you in a bit.

60
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.600
Yeah, sounds good.

61
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.500
- Hello.
- Hi.

62
00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:09.900
I don't believe we've met.

63
00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.333
I'm JR.

64
00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:13.033
Bella, hi.
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.100
You too.
Are you here for an adoption?

66
00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.400
No, I think I'm a little old
for that.

67
00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:19.467
I meant a dog.

68
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.667
Ah.

69
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:23.867
Well, we're just about to start
the luncheon

70
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.567
and talk about sponsorships
and adoptions

71
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.000
if you would like to stay.

72
00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:30.133
Sure. Yeah, why not.

73
00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:33.800
Okay, well, help yourself
to some food, fresh juices.

74
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.500
Hi, everyone,
thank you so much for coming.

75
00:03:41.633 --> 00:03:45.700
As most of you know, this rescue
center was started 25 years ago

76
00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:47.700
by my grandmother, Lily.

77
00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:54.300
Oh! And it appears our newest
guest has arrived.

78
00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.166
This is Indie, she just arrived
this morning from Kandahar...

79
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.667
Whoa, hey.

80
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.266
Bella: And we are so happy
to have her.

81
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.900
And thanks to all of you,

82
00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.700
we're going to be able to give
Indie a new life.

83
00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.767
I also wanted to extend a very
special thank-you

84
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.467
to Stockard Pet Foods.

85
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.934
They have continued their
generous support

86
00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:14.100
and have been with us
since the beginning,

87
00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:16.233
so thank you, Stockard!

88
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.000
All right, well,
enjoy the afternoon.

89
00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:23.734
Let me know if you need anything,

90
00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.967
and thank you again for coming.

91
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.934
Hey.

92
00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:31.467
So sorry about that.
We were just walking past,

93
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.633
I don't know why she decided to
crash the party.

94
00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:34.900
That's okay.

95
00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:36.400
Looks like she made a new
friend, though.

96
00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:38.734
Who was that?
I didn't recognize him.

97
00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:40.567
Oh, uh, yeah, I don't know.

98
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.033
He said his name was JR.

99
00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:45.367
Did you scare him away?

100
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Okay, I'll take her back
to the kennel.

101
00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:47.633
Okay.

102
00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:48.734
Come on!

103
00:04:57.567 --> 00:04:59.600
It's open.

104
00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:00.900
Welcome back!

105
00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.900
Dale. It's good to see you.

106
00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:04.533
You as well.
How long has it been?

107
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:05.967
Almost 10 years.

108
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.133
Does it feel good to be back?

109
00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:08.667
Feels good not to have to shave
for a while.

110
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.333
How long are you staying?

111
00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:13.133
My next tour is in 45 days,
so I've got a leave until then.

112
00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:14.567
Well, that's great.

113
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.533
I spoke with
Rachel Montgomerie earlier.

114
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:17.700
How are things going with
the closing?

115
00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:19.100
Good.

116
00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:20.967
What's next for you?

117
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.834
Rachel asked me to stay on to
continue running the company.

118
00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:25.834
Well, after 20 years,

119
00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:28.166
you know the business better
than anyone else.

120
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.300
Dale:
I'd better get back to work.

121
00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:33.400
Good to have you back.

122
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.834
Here's your good-night cookie.
'Night, night.

123
00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.767
Are you ever going to stop
tucking them in for the night?

124
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.133
Aww, no. 'Cause they deserve
all the love I can give them.

125
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:47.500
Nothing makes me happier
than when they go

126
00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.000
to their forever homes,

127
00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:50.567
getting all the love and
care they need.

128
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.500
You're a doll. You know that?

129
00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:54.333
- I love you, honey.
- I love you too.

130
00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:55.800
'Night, sweetie.
See you in the morning, okay?

131
00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:56.867
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, kids.

132
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800
Sleep tight.

133
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.100
You're not feeling this,
are you?

134
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:05.033
All right, you can come
hang out with me.

135
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.533
What do you think?

136
00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:08.767
All right.

137
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.000
Whoa! All righty.

138
00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:22.266
Okay.

139
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.266
Bella:
What's wrong, girl?

140
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.066
You don't seem very happy.

141
00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:33.133
Want to bunk with me tonight?

142
00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.166
Okay, let's go.

143
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.533
- Good morning.
- Morning.

144
00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.433
Your tea.
Just give me two seconds.

145
00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:57.233
- Hi!
- Muffins...

146
00:06:57.367 --> 00:06:58.567
Bella:
I will take her for you.

147
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.934
- Here she is!
- Oh my gosh, Maddie,

148
00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:01.834
you need a suitcase
for all of those.

149
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.633
How's Indie doing?

150
00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:06.600
Uh, she's a little uneasy.

151
00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:08.800
Have you had any luck
finding her file?

152
00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:10.533
No, but I've requested it.

153
00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:12.600
Okay, yeah, I think it will be
helpful if we can find out

154
00:07:12.734 --> 00:07:14.567
a bit more about her past.

155
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.767
Well, meanwhile she'll be just
fine here with us, won't she?

156
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.967
Yes.

157
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.266
Just don't get too
attached, Nana,

158
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.867
you know the rules.
You made them.

159
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.133
Lily: I know, I know. You keep
that there, lovely girl.

160
00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:26.700
Maddie, do you mind if I give
you this little munchkin?

161
00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.834
Hey, Miss Indie,
you want to go for a walk?

162
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:30.333
Does that sound fun?
Come on.

163
00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:31.600
Let's go this way.

164
00:07:41.734 --> 00:07:43.367
All right, let's go.

165
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.433
"We regret to inform you that
Stockard Pet Food

166
00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.200
"will not renew its annual support

167
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:52.300
"of Bella's Rescue Center as of
the date of this letter."

168
00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:54.166
What?

169
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.266
This is unbelievable!

170
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.066
And it's so abrupt.
It doesn't make any sense.

171
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.867
And Dorothy
was your best friend,

172
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.633
she would be appalled
that this is happening.

173
00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.900
Yeah, she would.
She loved this place.

174
00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.567
But she died
two years ago, Nana,

175
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.367
and no one has so much as
mentioned stopping the funding.

176
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.567
They could have at least given
us a little bit of notice.

177
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.767
Yeah.

178
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.100
You know what?
I'm going to go over there

179
00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:17.900
and see if I can figure
this out.

180
00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:20.400
All right, good. Do you want
to take this with you?

181
00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.166
Yeah, thanks.
I'll be back in a bit, okay?

182
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.500
Okay.

183
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.033
How are sales coming along?

184
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:30.266
Lots of people are stocking up
before the changeover.

185
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.934
Good. Good.

186
00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:35.033
In fact, I have a big customer
coming in in about five,

187
00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:37.533
so I should get back to
my office.

188
00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:40.200
Sure, I need to get back to
the house, anyway.

189
00:08:40.332 --> 00:08:42.500
- Good to see you again.
- Dale: Same here.

190
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.266
JR?

191
00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:49.367
It is JR, right?

192
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.567
Bella, yes. Hi.

193
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.533
Do you work here?

194
00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:54.166
No. No, I don't.

195
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.100
It was my parents' company.

196
00:08:57.233 --> 00:09:01.400
Oh, so you're JR Stockard of
Stockard Pet Foods.

197
00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:02.800
Yes, I am.

198
00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:06.266
Well, now I know why you
ran off so quickly

199
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.166
and didn't fully introduce yourself.

200
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.734
Why did you come
in the first place?

201
00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:15.166
Lily was my mom's best friend.
I wanted to say hi.

202
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.066
Really.

203
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.467
Yes, I haven't been back here
in 10 years,

204
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.066
and since I just sold
the company,

205
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.734
I thought it would be nice
to drop in, say hello.

206
00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:24.400
You thought it would be nice.

207
00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:26.767
Were you planning on breaking
the bad news

208
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.467
to my grandmother in person?

209
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.066
I'm sorry, but I don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

210
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.133
Then why did you run off
so quickly?

211
00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:34.633
Because you thanked Stockard.

212
00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:36.100
I don't own the company anymore.

213
00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:37.600
Or at least I won't
in a few weeks.

214
00:09:37.734 --> 00:09:39.233
I didn't know what to say.

215
00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:41.166
Well, you could have said that
you're leaving us

216
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.000
high and dry with no notice.

217
00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:44.667
High and dry?

218
00:09:53.266 --> 00:09:54.734
I don't know anything
about this.

219
00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:57.633
Well, surely your parents would
have told you something.

220
00:09:57.767 --> 00:09:59.000
My mom loved the center.

221
00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:00.433
She loved dogs more than
she loved people.

222
00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.433
That's all I know.

223
00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:05.800
You can't expect us to just pick
up the pieces in five minutes,

224
00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:07.400
JR, that's unreasonable.

225
00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:10.433
I'll look into it.
I'll call my lawyer.

226
00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:13.266
I just don't know that there's
that much that I can do.

227
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.834
This is going to be devastating
for my Nana.

228
00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:18.834
Hello, JR.

229
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.767
Who's this?

230
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.300
Hi.

231
00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:23.734
Rachel Montgomerie.

232
00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:27.233
Bella Channing.

233
00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:29.700
I run the dog rescue center
next door.

234
00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.700
Rachel owns a line of
pet food stores.

235
00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:33.800
And she's bought Stockard.

236
00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.233
Oh.

237
00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:36.800
Would you excuse me,
I'm very sorry.

238
00:10:36.934 --> 00:10:38.000
I have to get back
to the house.

239
00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:39.233
Will you tell Lily
that I'll come by?

240
00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:40.266
Thanks.

241
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.834
Rachel.

242
00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:44.567
Oh, Rachel, um, I don't know
if this is a good time,

243
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.567
but maybe we could talk.

244
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.600
I got this notice from Stockard
Pet Foods this morning.

245
00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:51.033
Do you know anything about it?

246
00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:53.567
Of course, I practically
own the place now.

247
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.033
Just a couple more weeks and
a few documents away.

248
00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:59.567
Well, maybe you could come by,
I could show you around,

249
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.600
convince you to reconsider.

250
00:11:01.734 --> 00:11:04.633
I'm so sorry, Bella, it's just
not part of the business plan.

251
00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:08.200
In fact, I'm planning to knock
the entire place down.

252
00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:11.133
Wait, what? You can't do that.

253
00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:14.400
Well, why not? I own it.
At least, I will soon.

254
00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:16.867
Uh, no, my grandmother owns it

255
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.200
and she would never sell it,
to you or anyone.

256
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:20.967
I'm so sorry to disappoint you,

257
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.667
but your shelter and the house
are on Stockard property.

258
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.633
I'm sure your grandmother must
be aware of this.

259
00:11:25.767 --> 00:11:27.400
And as soon as I get possession,

260
00:11:27.533 --> 00:11:29.667
I'm gonna have to get you
to move.

261
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.166
Oh, that reminds me.
I have something for you.

262
00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:35.000
Here you go.

263
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.033
Oh, how'd it go?

264
00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.000
We have 60 days to get out.

265
00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:52.000
What?!

266
00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:53.700
Yeah.

267
00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:56.700
Come on.

268
00:11:56.834 --> 00:11:58.300
Well, this is nonsense.

269
00:11:58.433 --> 00:12:01.934
We bought this land from George
and Dorothy 25 years ago.

270
00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:04.500
They severed off 10 acres.

271
00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:06.433
We spent our life savings
buying this land,

272
00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:08.700
and then we built the house
and the shelter.

273
00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:10.333
We own it outright.

274
00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:12.367
Then why are they saying that
Stockard owns it?

275
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500
Oh, I don't know.

276
00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.700
If the land was legally severed

277
00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.367
and you paid for it,
then it's yours.

278
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.600
So you would have to have
a sales agreement

279
00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:22.266
and a proof of the severance,
right?

280
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.567
Well, yes,
I've seen the document.

281
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.600
Do you have any idea
where it might be?

282
00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:29.900
No. But it has to be
in this house,

283
00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:31.467
because your grandfather
saved everything.

284
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.400
He never threw anything away.

285
00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:36.633
Okay. Then we'll just have to
look for it.

286
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.200
Maybe we should call Edward
Colvin, he's a very nice man.

287
00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:46.433
He's the Stockards' lawyer.

288
00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:48.266
I'm sure he has a copy.

289
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.834
Yeah, that's a very
good idea, Nana.

290
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.834
A very good idea.

291
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.734
Let's go.

292
00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:06.166
How could Stockard own the
rescue center?

293
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.133
It doesn't make any sense.

294
00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:09.800
It's clear as day.

295
00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:11.567
It was built on Stockard property,

296
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.867
so your parents owned it.

297
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.467
Yes, but it has to be a mistake.

298
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.300
My parents never said that
they owned it.

299
00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:19.500
In fact, they always referred to
it specifically as Lily's place.

300
00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.500
Well, I guess it was
Lily's place

301
00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.266
if she ran the shelter,

302
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.500
but for all we know, your
parents built it.

303
00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:28.967
Lily has no claim to something
that was never hers.

304
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.500
So, what happens now?

305
00:13:30.633 --> 00:13:32.333
You've already cut off their sponsorship

306
00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:34.333
and now they find out they don't
even own the place.

307
00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:36.600
I'm not a heartless woman.

308
00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:39.200
I gave them 60 days' notice
to vacate.

309
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.967
That should be enough time.

310
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.967
60 days?

311
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.433
You realize it's a dog rescue
center, right?

312
00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:49.600
That's... Rachel,
that's completely unreasonable.

313
00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:52.867
Look, JR, I love dogs
as much as anyone,

314
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.967
but Stockard owns it,
and I've purchased Stockard.

315
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.834
Yeah.

316
00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:05.867
Thank you for seeing me on such
short notice, Mr. Colvin.

317
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.867
Oh, anything for your grandmother.

318
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.867
She tells me that you represent
the Stockard family.

319
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.233
I do. Unfortunately,

320
00:14:13.367 --> 00:14:16.500
I wasn't their lawyer when this
transaction occurred.

321
00:14:16.633 --> 00:14:20.000
But after your call, I did
a search at the land registry,

322
00:14:20.133 --> 00:14:24.133
and oddly enough,
there are no records whatsoever

323
00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:26.433
of any severance or sale
of the property.

324
00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:28.000
How is that possible?

325
00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:30.066
I have no answer for you, Bella.

326
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.166
Does that mean
there's nothing we can do?

327
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.467
Well, unless we can find Lily's
copy of the document, not much.

328
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.867
Of course, you could always
take it to court.

329
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.834
Hmm, that would cost a lot of
money, wouldn't it?

330
00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:44.600
Possibly.

331
00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:47.333
And I have a feeling Rachel
Montgomerie would fight us

332
00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:49.367
every step of the way.

333
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.900
Well, I guess the best bet is
just to search through

334
00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:55.066
my grandfather's old storage
boxes, then.

335
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.233
I'm very sorry that you
have to deal with this.

336
00:14:58.367 --> 00:15:02.066
And please, give my very best
regards to your grandmother.

337
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.800
I'll come by the center
someday soon and say hello.

338
00:15:04.934 --> 00:15:07.433
I'm sure she'd really love that.

339
00:15:07.567 --> 00:15:09.567
Well, thank you again
for seeing me.

340
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.233
You're quite welcome.

341
00:15:12.367 --> 00:15:14.433
Lily: Oh, I have no interest
in going to court,

342
00:15:14.567 --> 00:15:16.233
and it would cost a fortune anyway.

343
00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:18.333
I know, we'll just focus on sponsorships

344
00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:19.900
and we will get through this.

345
00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:21.633
Yep. And Pooches in the Park
is coming up,

346
00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:23.467
and that's always a big success,
right?

347
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.900
Yeah, we'll just have to make it
a little extra this year.

348
00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:27.266
Yeah.

349
00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:36.834
Are you still looking for birds?

350
00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:39.200
Yes, I was.

351
00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:42.433
I remember when you built that birdhouse.

352
00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.800
Aww, she likes you.

353
00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:46.233
How are you? Yeah.

354
00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:47.900
Hi.

355
00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:49.133
Aww, honey. Good to see you.

356
00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.400
It's good to see you too.

357
00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.533
Oh. How long has it been?

358
00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:53.266
Far too long.

359
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.100
I miss your mom every day.

360
00:15:57.233 --> 00:16:00.533
So do I. And I'm really,
really sorry

361
00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:02.200
to hear about what's happening
with the center.

362
00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:03.934
She never would have let
something like this happen.

363
00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:05.467
And Lily, if I had known--

364
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.700
Oh, it's not your fault, JR. Honestly.

365
00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.900
Well, if there's anything I can
do, please just let me know.

366
00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:15.834
Well, as a matter of fact,
um, there might be.

367
00:16:16.967 --> 00:16:18.333
Oh.

368
00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:19.633
I'll tell you what,
I'll walk Indie

369
00:16:19.767 --> 00:16:21.333
and I'll let you two talk, okay?

370
00:16:21.467 --> 00:16:24.000
Come on, sweetie.
Don't be a stranger, JR.

371
00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:25.934
I promise I won't.

372
00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:29.734
Do you think maybe we could
start over?

373
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.400
I think that would be nice.

374
00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:36.633
Uh, you hungry?

375
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.300
Want to get something to eat
or some coffee?

376
00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:41.166
Yeah. I know a really nice
place, really close by.

377
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.600
- Okay.
- Okay.

378
00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:52.000
It's funny how I grew up right
next to the center

379
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:54.367
but I never really understood
its value.

380
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.800
To me, it was just a park with
lots of cute dogs, puppies.

381
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.533
Did you ever come over
to see it?

382
00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:01.900
Yeah, I was there practically
every day.

383
00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:04.567
My parents worked a lot,

384
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.733
so the grounds became
my playground

385
00:17:06.867 --> 00:17:09.433
and the dogs were my
best friends.

386
00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:11.467
Your grandmother became like
a second mother to me.

387
00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.032
Yeah, she's amazing.

388
00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:17.032
I used to come out here every
summer growing up.

389
00:17:17.165 --> 00:17:19.700
I couldn't wait for school
to be out.

390
00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:21.800
You know, I'm surprised
we never met.

391
00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.934
Well, I'd go stay with
my grandparents in Cambridge

392
00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:29.934
during the summers,
and after high school I left.

393
00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:32.066
Did you not like it here?
Small town life?

394
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.266
No, it wasn't that.

395
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.633
My dad died 10 years ago

396
00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.333
and my mom didn't really want
to stay here any longer,

397
00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:44.467
so we packed up and moved
back to Cambridge,

398
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.200
and she handed management
of the company over to Dale.

399
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.033
I think she held onto the
business, though,

400
00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:52.367
hoping that one day I might
come back and run it.

401
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.233
And you didn't want to do that?

402
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.633
I wanted to see the world,

403
00:17:57.767 --> 00:18:00.934
so I went to military college.
Joined the army.

404
00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:03.834
Oh. Are you still with
the military?

405
00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:05.834
Yeah, I'm stationed in Belgium.

406
00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:07.867
I came back here with an
extended leave

407
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.100
to deal with the sale.

408
00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:10.867
Wow.

409
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.834
Is it hard? Selling, I mean.

410
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:16.800
I always knew
this day would come,

411
00:18:16.934 --> 00:18:20.700
but it does feel different now
that it's actually here.

412
00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:22.600
But how about you?
Where are you from?

413
00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.266
I grew up in Vancouver.

414
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.800
Big city girl.

415
00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:28.700
No, not really.

416
00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:30.500
I'm a country bumpkin at heart.

417
00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:34.166
And I lived for
coming out here as a kid.

418
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.266
Who wouldn't want to play with
puppies all day?

419
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.200
I agree.

420
00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.867
And then after I graduated
from high school,

421
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.367
I went to university
to study dance.

422
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.967
Do you still dance?

423
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.533
No, shortly after I graduated,
I got injured,

424
00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:50.834
so I had to stop dancing.

425
00:18:50.967 --> 00:18:52.500
I'm sorry to hear that.

426
00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:54.600
That's okay.

427
00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:58.100
I thought about my life
long and hard after that,

428
00:18:58.233 --> 00:19:02.300
and I decided that this was
where I needed to be.

429
00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:05.367
So, I packed up all my stuff,

430
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.767
said goodbye to my parents.

431
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.166
Here I am, four years later.

432
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.400
Any regrets?

433
00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:12.533
Uh-uh.

434
00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:14.133
Not one.

435
00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:17.500
Even despite the current situation.

436
00:19:17.633 --> 00:19:22.100
It's a minor setback.

437
00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:24.066
I'll sort it out.

438
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.600
I owe it to my Nana.

439
00:19:26.734 --> 00:19:28.400
What can I do to help?

440
00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:31.867
Well, uh, Nana said that she and
my Grandpa bought the property

441
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.867
from your parents 25 years ago.

442
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.600
It was legally severed and there
was a document to prove it

443
00:19:37.734 --> 00:19:41.300
but they can't find any record
of it or the sale.

444
00:19:41.433 --> 00:19:44.333
Is there any way your parents
would have kept a copy of it?

445
00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:46.900
I don't know,
but I'll definitely look.

446
00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:48.900
I'll see if I can find it.

447
00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:50.700
Thank you.

448
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:02.233
Well, how did your talk
with JR go?

449
00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.667
Oh, yeah, it went well.

450
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.266
Um, he was actually really nice.

451
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.100
He said he's going to see
if he can find a copy

452
00:20:07.233 --> 00:20:08.667
of the severance for us.

453
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.767
You know, I am sure
that his parents or somebody

454
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.967
at the company must have
had a copy.

455
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.433
Yeah, well, in the meantime,

456
00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:17.433
we have a lot of boxes
to go through,

457
00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:18.800
and we'll get through it.

458
00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:20.667
Lily: I know we will,
and thank you.

459
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.734
But right now I'm more worried
about getting more sponsorships

460
00:20:23.867 --> 00:20:25.567
for the dogs,
so we can keep going.

461
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.333
Well, we could always start a
company selling your dog treats.

462
00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:30.967
All the dogs love them.

463
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.400
You know what? I am not
a "standing in the kitchen,

464
00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:35.567
"baking cookies"
kind of a gal, Bella.

465
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.000
Says the woman who does it
almost every single day.

466
00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:41.567
Well, that's because
I love my puppies.

467
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.233
Ah-ah! Last I checked,
you weren't a puppy.

468
00:20:44.367 --> 00:20:45.800
Aw, but they smell so good.

469
00:20:45.934 --> 00:20:47.433
Oh, I talked to Jill today.

470
00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:49.400
Who? Jill from the TV station?

471
00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:51.900
Yeah, she loves the rescue program,

472
00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:54.200
and she's going to give us some
coverage for the fundraiser.

473
00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:56.367
Oh!

474
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.967
Never a dull moment.

475
00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:01.300
We'll take them back.

476
00:21:01.433 --> 00:21:03.100
It's okay.

477
00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:05.266
Oh, I'm gonna miss this place.

478
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.734
Hey, don't say that.
We're gonna find this document,

479
00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:10.133
and we're gonna sort this out,
okay?

480
00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:11.333
Hello?

481
00:21:11.467 --> 00:21:12.567
Hey.

482
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.033
Wow, someone is happy
to see you.

483
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.934
How are you? Nice to see you.

484
00:21:18.066 --> 00:21:19.166
She's a special one.

485
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.567
Yeah.

486
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.333
Well, I have some good news.
I spoke to Dale,

487
00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.633
and he was able to release
some funds

488
00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:26.000
for your upcoming Pooches
in the Park.

489
00:21:26.133 --> 00:21:27.500
Oh, wow. Thanks, JR.

490
00:21:27.633 --> 00:21:28.700
We weren't expecting that.

491
00:21:28.834 --> 00:21:31.667
Whoa. $10,000?!

492
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.900
JR, this is way more than usual.

493
00:21:34.033 --> 00:21:36.066
It was the full amount left in
the sponsorship account

494
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.734
for the year.
Hopefully it helps.

495
00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:40.166
Oh, it helps more
than I can say. Thank you.

496
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.567
You're welcome.

497
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.400
I'm also going to talk
to Rachel,

498
00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:44.734
'cause I think
I can get her to agree

499
00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:46.333
to a six month extension
for you.

500
00:21:46.467 --> 00:21:49.900
Wow, that would be amazing.
I mean, if nothing else,

501
00:21:50.033 --> 00:21:52.233
it would give us time to get all
of the dogs housed

502
00:21:52.367 --> 00:21:54.166
and relocate if we need to.

503
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.900
Well, I'll talk to my contacts

504
00:21:56.033 --> 00:21:57.500
and I'll see if I can drum up
some sponsorship support.

505
00:21:57.633 --> 00:21:59.333
I take it you haven't had any
luck finding

506
00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:00.934
that severance document yet?

507
00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:03.533
No, not yet,
but I'm working on it.

508
00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:05.533
Hey, do you want to help me get
these little munchkins

509
00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:06.867
back to the kennels?

510
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.066
Yes, of course.

511
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.533
I very much do.

512
00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:11.900
- For you.
- For me?

513
00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:12.900
- Hello!
- Oh my goodness.

514
00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:15.266
- Come on.
- Okay, buddy.

515
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.734
Yeah. Say goodbye to Nana!

516
00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:18.033
All right.

517
00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:19.467
Bye-bye, Nana.

518
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.367
I love you. Mwah, mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah.

519
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.600
Okay, say your goodbyes.

520
00:22:22.734 --> 00:22:24.133
- Bye, Lily.
- Goodbye.

521
00:22:25.734 --> 00:22:27.200
Let's go.

522
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:29.266
Wow. This has changed
quite a bit

523
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.934
since the last time I saw it.

524
00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:34.033
It's nicer than most of
the places I've lived lately.

525
00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:35.934
You have a lot of military dogs.

526
00:22:36.066 --> 00:22:37.867
Yeah, military and police.

527
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.533
- Ooh.
- Bye, buddy.

528
00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:41.567
We'll take any dog, but
especially the working ones.

529
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.467
A lot of them are traumatized,
so we try to make this

530
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.367
as much like home as possible.

531
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.066
There you go...

532
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.533
Well, these dogs work hard.
That's all they know.

533
00:22:51.734 --> 00:22:53.467
You seem familiar with them.

534
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.100
Yeah, some of my assignments,
I've worked alongside K9 units.

535
00:22:57.233 --> 00:22:58.867
Then you understand them.

536
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.200
A lot of them are lost
when they get here.

537
00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:05.133
Well, they're lucky to have
someone like you.

538
00:23:05.266 --> 00:23:07.867
That's why keeping the shelter
open is so important.

539
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.834
Closing it is not an option.

540
00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:14.300
I'm gonna do whatever I have to
to keep it open.

541
00:23:14.433 --> 00:23:16.100
Do they even watch the TV?

542
00:23:16.233 --> 00:23:17.367
Cat videos.

543
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.767
No baseball?

544
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.200
Not yet.

545
00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:22.166
Hey, Jen, can you keep an eye
on the puppies?

546
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.100
- Jen: Sure!
- Awesome, thanks.

547
00:23:24.233 --> 00:23:27.100
Bye, cutie. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:30.867
I think it's even nicer here now
than I remember.

549
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.300
Yeah, well,
my Nana and Grandpa

550
00:23:33.433 --> 00:23:35.633
put every penny they had into
building this place.

551
00:23:35.767 --> 00:23:37.333
Nana still does.

552
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:39.300
Lily:
Well, good news!

553
00:23:39.433 --> 00:23:42.200
We just got a check from Solomon Construction,

554
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:44.467
and Mr. Solomon
is bringing his rescue pup

555
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.834
to Pooches in the Park.

556
00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:47.934
Oh, that's great. And what about
Mr. Doshi?

557
00:23:48.066 --> 00:23:49.700
- He's in too.
- Amazing!

558
00:23:49.834 --> 00:23:51.600
Sounds like you're off to
a good start.

559
00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:54.367
Bella: Yeah, well, we need as
many sponsorships as we can get.

560
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.266
Oh! It's Mr. Kelly.

561
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.266
Well, I'm going to head out,
go for a quick run,

562
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.700
and when I get back, I'll see if
I can get a few more, too.

563
00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.166
Thank you.

564
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.900
If you want,
I can take her with me.

565
00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:08.567
I'm sure she can use a run, too.

566
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.500
Uh, well, I actually have a
family coming by today

567
00:24:10.633 --> 00:24:12.066
that I was thinking of
introducing her to.

568
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.900
Oh.

569
00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:18.467
But there's... there's a lot of
other dogs they can meet.

570
00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:22.100
Great.

571
00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:23.533
I'll come by
and pick her up later.

572
00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:25.066
Sounds good.

573
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.266
Indie, let's go!

574
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.867
- Bye, Indie.
- Bye!

575
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.533
Pickles is really sweet.
But we have a dog named Willow,

576
00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.233
we're going to bring her in,
see how he responds.

577
00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:39.200
- Yeah?
- She's so calm.

578
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.200
Isn't she beautiful?

579
00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:46.066
Mom:
Yeah, she is.

580
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.900
I want to make sure
we find a dog that Ethan

581
00:24:48.033 --> 00:24:49.200
can feel comfortable with.

582
00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:51.834
Oh, of course.
I completely understand.

583
00:24:51.967 --> 00:24:53.934
We do have a lot of dogs
that are well-trained,

584
00:24:54.066 --> 00:24:57.066
but there's one military dog
who might be perfect.

585
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.333
She's really sweet.

586
00:24:58.467 --> 00:24:59.900
Is she available to see today?

587
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.400
Unfortunately, no,
but she'll be back tomorrow.

588
00:25:03.533 --> 00:25:07.467
In the meantime, let's see
how he and Willow do.

589
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.200
They seem to like each other.

590
00:25:11.133 --> 00:25:13.066
Yes, Bella's Rescue Center.

591
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.300
That's great. How's tomorrow?
Say 11 am?

592
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:20.567
Excellent. We'll see you then.

593
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.300
Thank you.

594
00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:25.400
Hey, Indie. Oh my goodness!

595
00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:28.100
I thought you would have wanted
to send her back by now.

596
00:25:28.233 --> 00:25:31.166
No, she was great on our run.
And then since we got back,

597
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.633
I've been talking on the phone,

598
00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:34.834
and she's mostly been sleeping
on my boots.

599
00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:36.633
I think she might like them more
than she likes me.

600
00:25:36.767 --> 00:25:39.433
Well, as long as she's not
chewing them, we're fine.

601
00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:41.000
I've made some appointments
for tomorrow.

602
00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.233
There seems to be a lot
of support for sponsorship.

603
00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:44.900
Oh, that's perfect!

604
00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:47.266
Yeah, I was going to head back
and make some calls too.

605
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.300
Do you want to stay and have
quick glass of iced tea?

606
00:25:49.433 --> 00:25:51.734
I just made a fresh batch.

607
00:25:51.867 --> 00:25:54.433
Oh, sure.
Yeah, I would love that.

608
00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:56.367
Come on, Indie. Let's go.

609
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.667
Hey, girl.

610
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.400
It's beautiful here.

611
00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:09.233
I didn't appreciate it
when I was a kid.

612
00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:12.000
And then coming back,
I realized just how lucky I was.

613
00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:16.500
Hmm. Can I ask? Why did it take
you so long to come back?

614
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.567
I think after my father died,
I was a little lost.

615
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.633
And everything here
reminded me of him.

616
00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:30.367
So I just didn't want to accept
the fact that he was gone.

617
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.033
I can't even imagine.

618
00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:34.734
But joining the military
was one of the best things

619
00:26:34.867 --> 00:26:36.400
that ever happened to me.

620
00:26:37.934 --> 00:26:39.800
At first I was probably
running away,

621
00:26:39.934 --> 00:26:42.166
but in the end,
I really found a purpose.

622
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.233
That's all you can hope for,
isn't it?

623
00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:46.533
Finding your purpose in life.

624
00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:50.066
How about you?
Have you found yours?

625
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.033
Yeah, I think I have.

626
00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:53.834
I wasn't sure about it at first,

627
00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:55.800
but when I came back
after my injury

628
00:26:55.934 --> 00:26:57.400
and started working
with the dogs,

629
00:26:57.533 --> 00:27:01.100
I just realized how much
I love it.

630
00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:03.266
I admire what you do.

631
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.266
Thank you.

632
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.400
Well, should we get going? Hmm?

633
00:27:09.533 --> 00:27:10.700
I've got some phone calls
to make,

634
00:27:10.834 --> 00:27:13.066
and a few hundred boxes
to go through.

635
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.767
Yeah, yeah. I have a few to go
through, as well.

636
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.233
And I really hope that we can
find those documents.

637
00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:20.767
Me too.

638
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.767
Well, maybe we can do this
again sometime.

639
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.900
I'll be here
for a little while longer.

640
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:29.200
I'd love that.

641
00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:32.133
All right, Indie. Come on.

642
00:27:32.266 --> 00:27:34.467
- Bye.
- Bye.

643
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.433
Come on, Indie.

644
00:27:36.567 --> 00:27:39.400
Oh, yeah.

645
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.767
Hello. Bella, right?

646
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.233
From the dog place next door.

647
00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:45.533
Yes, Rachel.

648
00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:47.133
From the rescue center
next door.

649
00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:49.433
Right, well, I'll let you
get on your way.

650
00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:51.700
I have some business
to do with JR.

651
00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:52.800
- Right.
- Excuse me.

652
00:27:57.934 --> 00:27:59.433
Hi.

653
00:27:59.567 --> 00:28:01.967
I was hungry, I thought you
might like to join me.

654
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.433
I wasn't expecting you today, Rachel.

655
00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:07.967
I was in the area,
thought I'd drop by.

656
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.100
Is there something important
that you'd like to discuss?

657
00:28:10.233 --> 00:28:11.800
You could have called.

658
00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:14.467
Uh, yeah, there's one small
matter we need to discuss.

659
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.000
Okay.

660
00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:18.367
There's a certain check
that was written earlier.

661
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.834
Rachel, that was already noted
in the sale agreement.

662
00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:22.467
And you should know,

663
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.467
I intend to honor any
commitments that were made.

664
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.600
It's really no concern of yours.

665
00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:29.166
You didn't have to give it.

666
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.467
I absolutely did.

667
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.700
I just don't want any hiccups
with the closing.

668
00:28:34.834 --> 00:28:36.300
Well, I think if you would
consider giving them

669
00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:38.133
a six-month extension,

670
00:28:38.266 --> 00:28:40.433
the goodwill would go
a long way.

671
00:28:42.467 --> 00:28:44.233
I'll think about it.

672
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500
How did the adoptions go today?

673
00:28:51.633 --> 00:28:54.900
Oh, well, Maddie made
two placements

674
00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.667
and I talked to
the Veterans' Affairs

675
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.300
and there's an injured soldier
just recently returned

676
00:29:00.433 --> 00:29:04.300
from Afghanistan, and she's
coming tomorrow with her family.

677
00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:07.266
Oh, that might be a good fit
for Indie.

678
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.066
Aw, you're going to miss her,
aren't you?

679
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.767
Yeah, I am.

680
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.467
She's a sweet one.

681
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.333
We've got a lot of sweet dogs
here, don't we?

682
00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:17.266
Yes, I know, sweetheart.

683
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.467
It's going to be really tough
letting them all go.

684
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.266
Yeah, well, it's always hard
saying goodbye to them,

685
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.400
but we can't give up
on the center.

686
00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:26.734
You own this place
fair and square.

687
00:29:26.867 --> 00:29:28.600
All we have to do is prove it.

688
00:29:28.734 --> 00:29:31.233
Well, it might be best if we
don't take anymore incoming,

689
00:29:31.367 --> 00:29:33.900
we just can't afford it.
And besides,

690
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:36.400
what are we going to do with all
of them when we have to leave?

691
00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:39.133
What are we gonna do with us?
We have to have a place to live.

692
00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:42.133
I know.

693
00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:44.500
Let's just get through Pooches
in the Park first.

694
00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:46.934
We'll raise as much money
as we can,

695
00:29:47.066 --> 00:29:49.633
and then if we can't find
the severance papers,

696
00:29:49.767 --> 00:29:53.433
we'll just find
the perfect place.

697
00:29:53.567 --> 00:29:56.166
You keep me going, you know,
with your positive attitude.

698
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.934
You never give up.

699
00:29:58.066 --> 00:30:01.300
Hmm, well, I just don't want
you to worry.

700
00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:04.033
We've got this. Right, Cash?

701
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.500
Good morning.

702
00:30:15.633 --> 00:30:17.800
Oh, hey! Come on in.

703
00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:19.233
Thank you.

704
00:30:21.367 --> 00:30:23.233
You're dedicated to these dogs.

705
00:30:23.367 --> 00:30:25.900
Yeah, well, I love them.
All of them.

706
00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:27.433
I see that.

707
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.567
Have you ever had a dog?

708
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.000
Yeah. Yeah, I had a few
when I was a kid.

709
00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:35.934
And then every time a new dog
came into the rescue center,

710
00:30:36.066 --> 00:30:37.166
I wanted to adopt it.

711
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.233
Do you miss having them?

712
00:30:39.367 --> 00:30:40.967
You know, I didn't think I did,

713
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.600
but coming back here,

714
00:30:42.734 --> 00:30:44.066
how do you not fall in love?

715
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.734
Bella:
Yeah, I know.

716
00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:49.266
Listen, I'm about to head into
town for my meetings,

717
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.600
and I was wondering if I could
bring Indie along with me.

718
00:30:52.734 --> 00:30:54.734
Bella:
Oh, um...

719
00:30:54.867 --> 00:30:56.633
Yeah, I don't know if that's
the best idea.

720
00:30:56.767 --> 00:30:58.300
She's just so new here,

721
00:30:58.433 --> 00:31:00.667
and she hasn't really been
adequately socialized yet.

722
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.000
I think she'd be a great
ambassador for the center.

723
00:31:03.133 --> 00:31:04.900
Plus, she'd really help with
my pitch meetings.

724
00:31:05.033 --> 00:31:07.834
And I think she really likes
hanging out with me.

725
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.467
And you like hanging out
with her?

726
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.400
She's okay.
We understand each other.

727
00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:15.533
Just don't get too attached,
okay?

728
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:17.500
You're leaving in a month.
Then what?

729
00:31:17.633 --> 00:31:20.533
I won't get attached. I promise.

730
00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:22.533
What about her?

731
00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:25.166
She needs to be adopted
as soon as possible.

732
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.367
Well, I'm confident
she'll find a home.

733
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.400
Well, I have a family coming
back to meet her

734
00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:33.166
at two o'clock today.

735
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.000
And there's a soldier
coming in as well.

736
00:31:35.133 --> 00:31:36.333
She just got back from Afghanistan,

737
00:31:36.467 --> 00:31:38.133
and Nana and I think that Indie

738
00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:39.800
might be the perfect fit
for her.

739
00:31:39.934 --> 00:31:41.567
I don't know if I'll be back
by two.

740
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.700
I will certainly try,
I'll do my best.

741
00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:46.734
You wouldn't be considering
delaying getting back,

742
00:31:46.867 --> 00:31:48.066
now would you?

743
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.000
Me? No. Never.

744
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.533
Okay.

745
00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:57.467
I will see you around two.

746
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.233
All right.

747
00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:00.567
Bye now.

748
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.467
Indie! Yes. Say bye!

749
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.400
She doesn't even miss me.

750
00:32:18.567 --> 00:32:19.734
Good girl.

751
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.467
Go find Ed! Yes!

752
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.867
Hello!

753
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.100
Well, she's a beautiful dog.

754
00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:29.800
Is she a soldier like yourself?

755
00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:31.433
Retired.

756
00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:34.433
But she's not mine,
just tagging along today.

757
00:32:34.567 --> 00:32:36.600
Suitable ambassador, though,
I hope.

758
00:32:36.734 --> 00:32:38.967
Yeah. Ah...

759
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.467
Good to see you, JR.
It's been a long time.

760
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.200
Yeah, it sure has.

761
00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:44.400
I'm glad you could make it home
in time for the closing.

762
00:32:44.533 --> 00:32:46.400
A lot of winding down to do
between the house

763
00:32:46.533 --> 00:32:47.967
and the business.

764
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.900
I'm sure you'll be relieved to
have it all done.

765
00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:52.867
You know, I thought would be,
but going through everything,

766
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.934
it's just starting to bring back
a lot of memories.

767
00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:57.633
And it's been really wonderful
seeing Lily.

768
00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:00.266
Mmm-hm. Have you met Bella yet?

769
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.333
Yeah. I've never met anyone
quite like her.

770
00:33:03.467 --> 00:33:04.967
She just has so much
determination, and--

771
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.633
That's her. Yeah.

772
00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:08.467
Tough time for her right now, though.

773
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.633
She came by to see me a couple
days ago about the severance.

774
00:33:11.767 --> 00:33:13.700
Yeah, it's a bit of a disaster.

775
00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:15.800
You didn't happen to find
anything helpful

776
00:33:15.934 --> 00:33:16.967
in the closing documents?

777
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.467
No, nothing.

778
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.967
So is there anything I can do
at this point?

779
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.934
Well, you sold the place, JR.

780
00:33:23.066 --> 00:33:24.667
Without physical proof of
that severance,

781
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.700
the rescue center and the house
belong to Stockard.

782
00:33:27.834 --> 00:33:30.166
Nothing you or I
or anyone can do about it.

783
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.000
All right.

784
00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:34.867
Well, let me know if I need to
come in and sign anything else.

785
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.667
Sure will. Yeah, and listen,

786
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.100
if you need any help further
down the line,

787
00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:40.600
just shout, all right?

788
00:33:40.734 --> 00:33:42.700
Well, there is one thing, actually.

789
00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:45.166
Bella's annual fundraiser is
coming up next week.

790
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.467
She's going to need to raise
additional funds this year.

791
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.700
Pooches in the Park.

792
00:33:48.834 --> 00:33:50.100
That's right.

793
00:33:50.233 --> 00:33:51.300
Do you think you
could be a sponsor?

794
00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:53.000
It really would mean a lot.

795
00:33:53.133 --> 00:33:55.867
Oh, absolutely, of course. Yeah.
And I'll get the word out.

796
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.700
There's still a few people
in this town

797
00:33:57.834 --> 00:33:59.433
who owe me a favor or two.

798
00:33:59.567 --> 00:34:02.166
That's great. Perfect.

799
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.266
What's this one's name?

800
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.233
This is Indie.

801
00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:07.066
Indie, come and see me.
Come here.

802
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.533
- Go say hi.
- Come here, sweetie.

803
00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:10.300
Oh, you're a beautiful girl.

804
00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:14.065
Here you go, Ethan.

805
00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.934
It's one of our "Bella's Rescue
Center" t-shirts.

806
00:34:16.065 --> 00:34:16.934
Ethan:
Thank you.

807
00:34:17.065 --> 00:34:18.033
You're welcome.

808
00:34:19.867 --> 00:34:21.533
I think Ethan has made
his decision.

809
00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:24.000
I think so too.
It makes me so happy.

810
00:34:24.132 --> 00:34:25.667
It makes everything we do here worthwhile.

811
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.166
Here you go.

812
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.065
And I'll get Maddie to set up
the paperwork,

813
00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.166
and that way you can head home
with her today.

814
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.766
Thanks.

815
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.567
Hi, how are we doing?

816
00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:39.000
Do you want to take her back?
Okay.

817
00:34:39.132 --> 00:34:40.934
Hey, I'm so sorry.

818
00:34:41.065 --> 00:34:43.533
We lost track of time.
I lost track of time.

819
00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:47.567
It's okay, I actually think your
timing is perfect.

820
00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.166
Everyone's already made their choices.

821
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.699
Volunteer:
And here we have Tundra.

822
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:52.199
Well, great. Okay.

823
00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:53.867
I guess we keep Indie for
another day then.

824
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.667
Yeah. But I did warn you not to
get too attached.

825
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.533
I'm not getting attached,
I promise.

826
00:34:58.667 --> 00:35:00.066
Mm-hm.

827
00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:03.400
But are you free
for a little while?

828
00:35:03.533 --> 00:35:04.934
Yeah, why, what's up?

829
00:35:05.066 --> 00:35:06.767
I just want to talk to you
about something.

830
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.734
Okay.

831
00:35:08.867 --> 00:35:10.066
And I got snacks,
so I hope you're hungry.

832
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.500
Oh, I like snacks.

833
00:35:15.767 --> 00:35:17.834
So I spoke with my lawyer today,
Edward Colvin.

834
00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:19.500
He mentioned that you came by.

835
00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:22.166
Uh, yeah, is there anything new
with the severance?

836
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.100
No, nothing. Sorry, Bella.

837
00:35:25.233 --> 00:35:28.600
I was really hoping that he'd
have something for us.

838
00:35:28.734 --> 00:35:30.967
Not the case.

839
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.400
Well, I guess we'll just have to
keep looking then.

840
00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:37.500
I guess so.

841
00:35:37.633 --> 00:35:39.600
Isn't it funny how when you're
looking for something,

842
00:35:39.734 --> 00:35:41.767
it's always the last thing
you find?

843
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.600
Yes, I've found that.

844
00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:47.633
Yeah, and it was always right
in front of you.

845
00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:49.333
Well, that happened to you.

846
00:35:49.467 --> 00:35:51.166
You came back here and you found
what you were looking for.

847
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.166
Yeah, I guess so.

848
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.467
And what I was really looking
for was a picnic by the water,

849
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.333
and here we are.
How did you know?

850
00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:00.834
Just a lucky guess.

851
00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:04.233
Oh, well, we should cheers.
To, uh, to luck

852
00:36:04.367 --> 00:36:06.567
and to finding what you're
looking for.

853
00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.467
Well, can I offer you a glass of
Bridal Falls' finest water?

854
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.700
Oh, well, does it go well
with cheese?

855
00:36:12.834 --> 00:36:13.967
Exquisitely.

856
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.033
Oh, I forgot to tell you!

857
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:22.033
I got a new sponsorship from
Victoire Champagne,

858
00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:24.033
and the Guinness
world record holder

859
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:26.800
for the most bottles
of Champagne sabered in a minute

860
00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:29.000
is going to come sabre some
Champagne for us.

861
00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:30.233
Well, that is extremely impressive,

862
00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:31.867
how did you manage that?

863
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.166
Ah, well, the holder of the
Guinness world record

864
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.967
is a good friend of mine.

865
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.367
Well, we'll be able to cheers
with the real thing, then.

866
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.867
Yes we will, and it definitely
goes well with cheese.

867
00:36:53.266 --> 00:36:56.734
Okay, well, that's 24 boxes down

868
00:36:56.867 --> 00:36:57.967
and 200 more to go.

869
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.467
Hey, good news, though.

870
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.000
We got four more sponsors today.

871
00:37:02.133 --> 00:37:03.667
Amazing!

872
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.033
No commitment of dollars yet,
but I'm working on it.

873
00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:09.100
That's great. Yeah, I'm going to
head downtown to see Chad soon.

874
00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:10.800
His partner Jeremy
works in real estate.

875
00:37:10.934 --> 00:37:12.467
Oh, that's great!

876
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.133
And, uh, what about JR?
How are things going there?

877
00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:16.767
No luck yet.

878
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.200
Bella.

879
00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:19.700
I'm not talking about
storage boxes

880
00:37:19.834 --> 00:37:23.033
and finding a certain document.

881
00:37:23.166 --> 00:37:25.533
Everything's fine.

882
00:37:25.667 --> 00:37:27.166
Uh-huh.

883
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.300
Okay, what is this "uh-huh"
about?

884
00:37:29.433 --> 00:37:32.533
Oh, you know, just a certain
very handsome young man

885
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:34.667
who just happens to be available...

886
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.934
- Don't go there.
- Why not?

887
00:37:37.066 --> 00:37:38.667
Because!

888
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.133
You're right, he is very handsome.

889
00:37:41.266 --> 00:37:42.333
Exactly.

890
00:37:42.467 --> 00:37:44.000
But he's definitely not available.

891
00:37:44.133 --> 00:37:45.333
Says who?

892
00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:47.000
- Says me.
- Oh.

893
00:37:47.133 --> 00:37:48.433
He's gonna be leaving
in a month,

894
00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:52.200
we're never going to
see him again.

895
00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:54.133
Okay, I have to go.

896
00:37:54.266 --> 00:37:57.467
I'm so not used to seeing you
with a boyfriend.

897
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.133
He's not my boyfriend!

898
00:38:01.567 --> 00:38:03.100
He's not my boyfriend.

899
00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:11.266
Hey, Chad.

900
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.200
Hey, Bella! The usual?

901
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.900
Oh, yeah, thanks.

902
00:38:15.033 --> 00:38:16.667
Bronwyn, berry blaster.

903
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.934
Bronwyn:
Coming up!

904
00:38:18.066 --> 00:38:19.834
Oh, and I brought some more posters.

905
00:38:19.967 --> 00:38:21.367
Oh, great!

906
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.000
Do you have a minute?

907
00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:25.767
Yeah, of course,
anything for you, Bella.

908
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.533
So we need to make the fundraiser

909
00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:33.100
a huge success this year.

910
00:38:33.233 --> 00:38:34.600
I don't know if you heard
the news.

911
00:38:34.734 --> 00:38:36.367
Yeah, JR dropped by yesterday.

912
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.166
He told me about
the severance problem.

913
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.533
I didn't know realize
you knew JR.

914
00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:41.867
Yeah, friends from high school.

915
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.400
Oh!

916
00:38:43.533 --> 00:38:45.233
What was he like back then?

917
00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:47.767
Pretty much the same, except
then he couldn't wait to leave,

918
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.433
and now we can't get rid of him.

919
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.567
Lily.

920
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.567
Ed! For goodness' sake!

921
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.567
Oh, it's so good to see you!

922
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.100
Ah, it's been years.

923
00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:05.333
Look, I apologize
for dropping in unannounced,

924
00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:06.967
but I was talking to JR
and Bella,

925
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.900
and they were telling me what
had happened, and...

926
00:39:10.033 --> 00:39:11.633
I'm so sorry.

927
00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:13.467
Oh, Ed, you don't have to
be sorry, it's not your fault.

928
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.567
Well, I was really kind of
hoping that I'd be able to find

929
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.467
something to help you.

930
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.233
I mean, if we can't find it,

931
00:39:20.367 --> 00:39:22.300
I guess we'll just have to make
the best of it and move on.

932
00:39:22.433 --> 00:39:23.800
Mm-hm. Time to retire, perhaps?

933
00:39:23.934 --> 00:39:27.133
Who, me? Oh, good heavens, no!
Oh, no, no, no.

934
00:39:27.266 --> 00:39:28.967
Anyway, rescue dogs don't care
how old you are

935
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.467
or what you look like.

936
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.467
They just like lots of care and
lots of love,

937
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.834
so I'm good.

938
00:39:33.967 --> 00:39:35.834
Well, look.
I really should get going,

939
00:39:35.967 --> 00:39:38.433
I've got a meeting later on
with some people who might

940
00:39:38.567 --> 00:39:40.300
be interested in bringing in
a sponsorship or two.

941
00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:43.166
Oh, awesome! Thank you!
I really appreciate it!

942
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.166
Thank you so much.

943
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.467
You're very welcome.

944
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.066
- Great seeing you.
- You too.

945
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.667
Uh, Ed, I'm just going to have
a cup of coffee.

946
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.000
Would you like to join me?

947
00:39:51.133 --> 00:39:52.633
I mean, if you have time,
of course.

948
00:39:52.767 --> 00:39:55.166
Oh, well, that would be great.

949
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.166
- Great!
- Yeah.

950
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.433
- Okay.
- Perfect.

951
00:39:57.567 --> 00:39:58.900
- Come on in then. Yeah.
- Thank you.

952
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.633
Lily:
Well, there you are.

953
00:40:06.767 --> 00:40:08.633
How did everything go today?

954
00:40:08.767 --> 00:40:10.800
Oh, good. I talked to Chad,

955
00:40:10.934 --> 00:40:13.066
and he's going to ask Jeremy
to look at some places

956
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.333
in case we need to find one.

957
00:40:14.467 --> 00:40:15.633
Great, great.

958
00:40:15.767 --> 00:40:18.233
Yeah. How was your day?

959
00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:19.567
Well, um, Ed dropped by today.

960
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.967
Ed?

961
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.567
Edward Colvin.
And he is working on

962
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.266
some really big sponsors for us.

963
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.900
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

964
00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:32.066
Why do I get the feeling
something is wrong?

965
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.400
Oh, no, no. I'm just...

966
00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:36.667
I'm just a little worried about
Indie, that's all.

967
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.967
Why? She seems to be settling in
very well.

968
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.633
I know...

969
00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:44.367
I just think it might
break her heart when JR leaves.

970
00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:47.834
Indie's heart or yours?

971
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.400
Hi, Lily.

972
00:40:50.533 --> 00:40:51.900
Lily:
Oh, hi!

973
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.967
Hi. Hi.

974
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.400
How's it going?

975
00:40:58.533 --> 00:41:00.066
Good. Yeah, good.

976
00:41:01.467 --> 00:41:03.033
I, uh, I was just wondering

977
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:05.533
if maybe you wanted to go grab
dinner with me.

978
00:41:05.667 --> 00:41:07.633
Honestly, I'm getting a little
tired of going through

979
00:41:07.767 --> 00:41:10.300
all these boxes, and then just
ordering takeout.

980
00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:12.867
Well, um, maybe you could have
dinner here with us.

981
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.467
Oh, no, don't look at me.

982
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.166
I'm not cooking dinner
for you guys.

983
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.333
I've got leftovers, for one.

984
00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:24.133
Okay, well, uh,

985
00:41:24.266 --> 00:41:25.900
I guess we're
having dinner then.

986
00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:28.100
Great. No complaints here.

987
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:32.200
Do you mind if I just take
a couple of minutes and change,

988
00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:33.967
'cause I'm covered in dog hair.

989
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.200
No, no, no, take your time.

990
00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:37.233
I've got someone
to keep me company.

991
00:41:37.367 --> 00:41:38.800
Okay.

992
00:41:44.133 --> 00:41:45.333
So rescuing military
and police dogs,

993
00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:48.367
that's pretty specific work.

994
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.467
It was inspired
by my Grandfather.

995
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.200
He served in Vietnam,

996
00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:55.166
and he was in charge of
the canine unit there.

997
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.533
When he came home,
he was really lost.

998
00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:02.100
Nana said he was a shell of
the man that he'd been.

999
00:42:02.233 --> 00:42:03.800
So the dogs saved him?

1000
00:42:03.934 --> 00:42:07.633
Yeah, I guess so.
And originally it just started

1001
00:42:07.767 --> 00:42:09.767
with him bringing home
homeless dogs,

1002
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.867
but Nana said they really calmed
him and gave him

1003
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.433
a sense of purpose.

1004
00:42:14.567 --> 00:42:17.266
So they decided to start
the rescue.

1005
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.967
They named it after you?

1006
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.967
Well, of course.

1007
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.567
And when I was little,
I told everyone I owned it.

1008
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.567
Well, now you do.

1009
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.900
Whatever's gonna be left of it, yeah.

1010
00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:29.633
Well, you'll still own it.

1011
00:42:29.767 --> 00:42:31.066
It might look a little bit different.

1012
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.533
I know, I know. I just...

1013
00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:35.433
I don't want to let
my Nana down.

1014
00:42:35.567 --> 00:42:38.100
It's hers and my Grandpa's
legacy.

1015
00:42:38.233 --> 00:42:39.900
And yours.

1016
00:42:40.033 --> 00:42:41.734
Eventually, I hope.

1017
00:42:43.367 --> 00:42:44.900
So what else is out there
for you?

1018
00:42:45.033 --> 00:42:46.633
Besides the rescue center
and work?

1019
00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:48.900
Any other big dreams
for your future?

1020
00:42:50.934 --> 00:42:53.967
Just to be happy.

1021
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.600
Maybe start a family one day,
but for now,

1022
00:42:56.734 --> 00:42:59.066
my life is pretty full.

1023
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:01.934
No boyfriend? No love?

1024
00:43:02.066 --> 00:43:03.500
Besides the dogs, of course.

1025
00:43:03.633 --> 00:43:06.200
Uh, no. No one.

1026
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:08.767
I had a boyfriend in university,

1027
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.934
and I thought we were going to
have our happily ever after,

1028
00:43:12.066 --> 00:43:13.934
but when we graduated,

1029
00:43:14.066 --> 00:43:15.700
he decided he didn't want
the same things,

1030
00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:18.700
so we went our separate ways.

1031
00:43:18.834 --> 00:43:22.333
And what, that was it?
You're just done with love?

1032
00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:24.333
What are you talking about?

1033
00:43:24.467 --> 00:43:27.433
I have puppies. Who needs men?

1034
00:43:27.567 --> 00:43:30.867
Sometimes you need people,
you know.

1035
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
That special someone.

1036
00:43:33.133 --> 00:43:37.033
It's not that I'm against love,
I just...

1037
00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:38.700
I just want to be careful.

1038
00:43:38.834 --> 00:43:41.300
You know, I don't want to give
my heart to someone

1039
00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:43.400
unless I know
they're the right person.

1040
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.100
This is my favorite
place to sit.

1041
00:43:49.233 --> 00:43:50.367
Well, it's very nice.

1042
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.133
I can see why.

1043
00:43:55.567 --> 00:43:57.100
So what about you?

1044
00:43:57.233 --> 00:43:59.300
Do you have anyone special
in your life?

1045
00:43:59.433 --> 00:44:02.300
No. No.

1046
00:44:04.734 --> 00:44:07.834
Like you, I dated someone
for a long time,

1047
00:44:07.967 --> 00:44:11.100
and...

1048
00:44:11.233 --> 00:44:12.900
I moved around a lot.

1049
00:44:13.033 --> 00:44:15.333
Long-distance relationships
are difficult.

1050
00:44:15.467 --> 00:44:19.400
Yeah, I imagine it's complicated
being in the army.

1051
00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:22.734
I don't know where we would be
without all of the sacrifices

1052
00:44:22.867 --> 00:44:25.667
you make for our country.

1053
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.567
I really admire that.

1054
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.600
Well, I don't consider it
a sacrifice.

1055
00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:33.066
I'm glad to do it.

1056
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.667
What about your future?

1057
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.066
Do you want to settle down?

1058
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.233
Yeah, I do.

1059
00:44:39.367 --> 00:44:40.867
I've thought about it a lot, actually,

1060
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.333
since coming back here.

1061
00:44:44.467 --> 00:44:47.533
Just realizing how much
I miss my parents.

1062
00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:50.533
What about your parents?
Where are they?

1063
00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:52.200
They're actually on a cruise
right now.

1064
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:54.033
It's the first trip
they've ever taken together.

1065
00:44:54.166 --> 00:44:56.700
They didn't even have
a honeymoon.

1066
00:44:56.834 --> 00:44:58.033
Well, sounds like they're proof

1067
00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:00.633
that a fairy tale ending
is possible.

1068
00:45:00.767 --> 00:45:03.467
I should probably say goodnight.

1069
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.567
I have a TV interview tomorrow
for Pooches in the Park.

1070
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.500
And Jill, the interviewer,

1071
00:45:09.633 --> 00:45:11.467
she wants to set up everything
in the kennels,

1072
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.333
so I kind of need to figure out
what to do with that.

1073
00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:16.233
Do you want any help with it?

1074
00:45:16.367 --> 00:45:19.500
If you don't mind moving
furniture around

1075
00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:20.967
and decorating with me, then...

1076
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.100
No, I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.

1077
00:45:23.233 --> 00:45:26.367
Okay! I would love the help.

1078
00:45:49.567 --> 00:45:51.066
Please join my interview.

1079
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.100
Yes, I think this will work
just fine.

1080
00:45:53.233 --> 00:45:56.166
Welcome to Bella's Beat.
Tell us about yourself.

1081
00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.133
Hello, my name is JR Stockard,
and I like dogs.

1082
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:15.567
Yeah, you did great.

1083
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.767
JR here.

1084
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.166
Hi, Edward.

1085
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.734
Bella's Rescue Center has been
here for over 25 years,

1086
00:46:31.867 --> 00:46:35.633
and to date, they have rescued
and successfully adopted

1087
00:46:35.767 --> 00:46:36.967
a thousand dogs.

1088
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.133
That's quite an impressive
record!

1089
00:46:39.266 --> 00:46:42.400
Thank you. Our mission has
always been to provide a home

1090
00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.166
for dogs that have been abandoned.

1091
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.934
And over the last four years,
we've expanded our services

1092
00:46:47.066 --> 00:46:49.066
to include police and
military dogs.

1093
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.500
That's admirable. And who do we
have here with you today?

1094
00:46:51.633 --> 00:46:55.000
This is Indie.
She recently served in Kandahar.

1095
00:46:55.133 --> 00:46:58.467
A soldier!
Is she available for adoption?

1096
00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.700
Yes, she is, actually.
She's settling in at the moment.

1097
00:47:01.834 --> 00:47:04.033
We're hoping to get her
an adoption as soon as we can.

1098
00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:06.533
But for now, she's acting
as our ambassador

1099
00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.700
for Pooches in the Park,
our annual fundraiser.

1100
00:47:08.834 --> 00:47:10.233
- Okay.
- Thanks, Maddie.

1101
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.900
This will be demolished as soon
as we can secure the permit,

1102
00:47:14.033 --> 00:47:15.467
so just take that away.

1103
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.000
Our new building is going to sit
right about here.

1104
00:47:20.133 --> 00:47:21.734
- Did you get the new drawings?
- I did.

1105
00:47:21.867 --> 00:47:23.333
I think you're going to want to
see this.

1106
00:47:23.467 --> 00:47:25.133
What is it?

1107
00:47:25.266 --> 00:47:26.800
Bella Pooches in the
Park is our annual drive...

1108
00:47:26.934 --> 00:47:28.233
Oh, it's that dog woman.

1109
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.700
Bella: ...where we aim
to find new sponsors

1110
00:47:29.834 --> 00:47:31.233
and raise all of the finances
that we need

1111
00:47:31.367 --> 00:47:33.233
to keep the center open
year-round.

1112
00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:34.800
This year, unfortunately,

1113
00:47:34.934 --> 00:47:38.166
we've experienced
some unexpected challenges.

1114
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.734
What is she trying to pull here?

1115
00:47:39.867 --> 00:47:41.333
Bella
In the meantime,

1116
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:43.300
we need all the financial
support that we can get

1117
00:47:43.433 --> 00:47:45.633
in order to make sure that we
can provide the basics

1118
00:47:45.767 --> 00:47:49.967
for all the dogs we have here,
including these two new puppies.

1119
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.567
Jill:
Hello, oh!

1120
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.467
Come on in, Bitty.
On top of everything else,

1121
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.700
unfortunately we have to move.
The company also owned

1122
00:47:57.834 --> 00:47:59.700
the land that Bella's Rescue
Center is on,

1123
00:47:59.834 --> 00:48:01.900
so we've been given notice
to vacate.

1124
00:48:02.033 --> 00:48:04.700
Listen to her! She's trying
to stir up trouble.

1125
00:48:04.834 --> 00:48:06.967
This is going to ruin me.

1126
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.467
I want her stopped.

1127
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.066
Call the mayor.
Get him on the phone. Now!

1128
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.633
I want the permits to demolish
this place.

1129
00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:17.767
Jill If you want to
help Bella's Rescue Center

1130
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.433
and these beautiful dogs,
then go to our website now.

1131
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.734
JR
Hey, you've reached JR.

1132
00:48:24.867 --> 00:48:26.734
You know what to do.

1133
00:48:26.867 --> 00:48:30.467
JR, hi, it's Rachel.
I need to see you.

1134
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.400
Actually, it's rather urgent.
I'm at my office, okay?

1135
00:48:37.934 --> 00:48:40.133
Bella: Oh, Indie was
the perfect ambassador.

1136
00:48:40.266 --> 00:48:41.800
I was so proud of her.

1137
00:48:41.934 --> 00:48:44.266
We already have over 16 adoption applications,

1138
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.700
and our website is blowing up.

1139
00:48:45.834 --> 00:48:48.300
Wow. What would be really great
is if we can get

1140
00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:50.100
some more sponsorships.

1141
00:48:50.233 --> 00:48:52.867
And I'm really hoping that JR
can convince Rachel

1142
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.100
to give us six months more.

1143
00:48:54.233 --> 00:48:55.900
Maddie:
Mmm-hm, let's hope.

1144
00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.867
Any news on finding
another place?

1145
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.900
Uh, Chad and Jeremy are
going to help,

1146
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.867
but we'll worry about that
after Pooches.

1147
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.934
Speaking of which,
we have the meeting

1148
00:49:05.066 --> 00:49:06.333
with the volunteers at two,

1149
00:49:06.467 --> 00:49:08.433
so we should probably
head out soon.

1150
00:49:15.667 --> 00:49:17.166
Here's your coffee,
Mr. Stockard.

1151
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.533
Thank you.

1152
00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:21.433
What do you think?

1153
00:49:21.567 --> 00:49:24.467
It's, uh, it's a different look.

1154
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.333
I was hoping to take some time

1155
00:49:27.467 --> 00:49:30.433
to talk about you, and us.

1156
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.867
Pardon me?

1157
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.333
Not in a romantic way,
don't be silly.

1158
00:49:37.467 --> 00:49:40.200
I'm talking business.
A partnership.

1159
00:49:40.333 --> 00:49:41.800
Here.

1160
00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:44.000
We would work well together,

1161
00:49:44.133 --> 00:49:45.667
building my business,

1162
00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.834
integrating Stockard employees
with the new company.

1163
00:49:48.967 --> 00:49:51.767
Creating more jobs
for the locals.

1164
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.200
First of all,
I'm not interested.

1165
00:49:54.333 --> 00:49:55.467
Oh.

1166
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.700
Secondly, I'm in the military.

1167
00:49:56.834 --> 00:49:58.033
I'll be out of here
in a few weeks.

1168
00:49:58.166 --> 00:50:00.133
Long distance would be fine.

1169
00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:04.333
You could set me up with all the
Stockard contacts before you go.

1170
00:50:04.467 --> 00:50:06.800
The mayor, local politicians.

1171
00:50:06.934 --> 00:50:11.533
I want my permits approved.
And I think you can help.

1172
00:50:11.667 --> 00:50:15.000
Well, Rachel, I would be happy
to help any way that I can.

1173
00:50:15.133 --> 00:50:18.700
But I'll need you to give Bella
that extension in writing.

1174
00:50:18.834 --> 00:50:21.000
Why are you so concerned
about Bella?

1175
00:50:21.133 --> 00:50:22.133
We're doing her a favor.

1176
00:50:22.266 --> 00:50:23.800
How so?

1177
00:50:23.934 --> 00:50:28.166
Well, you just think about
my offer, please,

1178
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.433
and I will consider that extension.

1179
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.700
Hello?

1180
00:50:43.333 --> 00:50:46.500
Okay, I'll see you guys later.
I've gotta go.

1181
00:50:46.633 --> 00:50:47.700
Hello?

1182
00:50:49.433 --> 00:50:50.533
Bella?

1183
00:50:56.433 --> 00:50:59.300
You do know those are dog
cookies, right?

1184
00:50:59.433 --> 00:51:01.700
All-natural, healthy ingredients,

1185
00:51:01.834 --> 00:51:04.567
but they're dog cookies.

1186
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.600
Yes, of course I do. Obviously.

1187
00:51:06.734 --> 00:51:07.900
If it's not delicious,

1188
00:51:08.033 --> 00:51:09.500
why would you give it
to your dog?

1189
00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:10.734
Do you have any milk?

1190
00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:11.734
That's not gonna help,
you know.

1191
00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:13.066
That's not my fault.

1192
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.700
There should be a warning
on them.

1193
00:51:14.834 --> 00:51:16.166
"Dangerously delicious."

1194
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.567
"So good your people
will steal them."

1195
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.500
Yes, they will.

1196
00:51:21.633 --> 00:51:22.900
- Lily, hi.
- Hello!

1197
00:51:23.033 --> 00:51:26.400
Hey, Indie! Hello.

1198
00:51:26.533 --> 00:51:29.767
Thank you. Listen.
I wanted to come by,

1199
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.433
let you know that I had an
interesting call

1200
00:51:31.567 --> 00:51:33.934
with Ed Colvin today.
Are these human cookies?

1201
00:51:34.066 --> 00:51:35.734
Yes, you're good to go.

1202
00:51:35.867 --> 00:51:37.533
Edward's been trying
to track down the lawyers

1203
00:51:37.667 --> 00:51:39.333
who represented my parents
25 years ago.

1204
00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:40.333
He finally found the firm.

1205
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.700
Unfortunately, the lawyer that
represented them passed away.

1206
00:51:44.834 --> 00:51:47.100
But they sold the practice
to a new lawyer,

1207
00:51:47.233 --> 00:51:49.100
He's reached out to her,
got in touch,

1208
00:51:49.233 --> 00:51:50.266
and they have a meeting today.

1209
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.600
Oh!

1210
00:51:51.734 --> 00:51:53.233
Nana, this could be really
good news.

1211
00:51:53.367 --> 00:51:55.233
I mean, if she has files that
prove that the land

1212
00:51:55.367 --> 00:51:57.200
was legally severed and
you paid for it.

1213
00:51:57.333 --> 00:51:58.867
Well, I know I did.

1214
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.967
I know, and I believe you,
but if we can't prove it,

1215
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.400
we're kind of in trouble.

1216
00:52:03.533 --> 00:52:05.633
Well, all right, in the meantime
while we're waiting,

1217
00:52:05.767 --> 00:52:07.266
we're just going to dig
a little deeper

1218
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.133
into those storage boxes
and hope that we can find it.

1219
00:52:10.266 --> 00:52:12.233
Well, I still have a lot more
to go through back at the house

1220
00:52:12.367 --> 00:52:13.567
and I'm going to get back
to it tonight.

1221
00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.333
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1222
00:52:15.467 --> 00:52:17.967
Lily, you're very welcome.

1223
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.600
Ah! I saw that. As soon as
I walked in the door,

1224
00:52:20.734 --> 00:52:22.400
I knew you were a dog cookie stealer.

1225
00:52:22.533 --> 00:52:25.567
Guilty. They're delicious.
Bye! Bye, Indie!

1226
00:52:44.033 --> 00:52:46.567
Crowd:

1227
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.967
Save Bella's Rescue!
Save Bella's Rescue!

1228
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.767
Have you contacted
the mayor yet?

1229
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.066
Yes.

1230
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.300
And are the permits ready?

1231
00:52:54.433 --> 00:52:55.800
Not yet,
but they're working on it.

1232
00:52:55.934 --> 00:52:58.000
Working on it? I don't pay you
to work on it.

1233
00:52:58.133 --> 00:52:59.767
I pay you to get things done.

1234
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.166
There's a woman here to see you
from the TV station,

1235
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.533
and there's protestors outside.

1236
00:53:04.667 --> 00:53:05.800
Protestors? What for?

1237
00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:08.000
To save Bella's Rescue Center.

1238
00:53:08.133 --> 00:53:10.200
I'm Jill from Bridal Falls TV.

1239
00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:13.633
Yes, yes, I know who you are.
I'm a very busy woman,

1240
00:53:13.767 --> 00:53:15.500
but I do turn the TV on occasionally.

1241
00:53:15.633 --> 00:53:18.700
That's great, because I wanted
to get a comment from you.

1242
00:53:18.834 --> 00:53:21.967
Our viewers were very upset
seeing Bella on television--

1243
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.734
Oh, Bella, lovely woman.

1244
00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:27.133
I understand that you have given
her notice to vacate,

1245
00:53:27.266 --> 00:53:29.367
and very little notice, at that.

1246
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.500
Well, that was
a misunderstanding.

1247
00:53:31.633 --> 00:53:33.633
I mean, you know how these
things can happen.

1248
00:53:33.767 --> 00:53:35.867
All I can say is that we are
here for Bella.

1249
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.500
I mean, we support the center,

1250
00:53:38.633 --> 00:53:41.367
and I will personally do
everything in my power to help.

1251
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.834
So you have the authority
to fix this.

1252
00:53:43.967 --> 00:53:45.700
You will find that I am
a very reasonable

1253
00:53:45.834 --> 00:53:48.033
and compassionate woman.
Now if you'll excuse me,

1254
00:53:48.166 --> 00:53:50.800
I'm also very busy.
Thank you for dropping by.

1255
00:53:50.934 --> 00:53:52.400
Could someone please
help her out?

1256
00:53:52.533 --> 00:53:55.633
No problem, queen.
I know how I came in.

1257
00:53:55.767 --> 00:53:59.000
Do you see why I need those
permits fast? Make it happen.

1258
00:53:59.133 --> 00:54:00.166
Right.

1259
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.233
Bella:
Oh, thank you for this.

1260
00:54:04.367 --> 00:54:06.033
Of course.

1261
00:54:06.166 --> 00:54:08.600
So, how is everything?

1262
00:54:08.734 --> 00:54:11.567
No luck yet, but I still have
a lot more boxes to go through.

1263
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.900
Oh, I, um, I meant for you.

1264
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:16.734
I've been taking up a lot
of your time.

1265
00:54:16.867 --> 00:54:19.934
Well, I've enjoyed every
minute of it.

1266
00:54:20.066 --> 00:54:22.100
Yeah. This is the most normal

1267
00:54:22.233 --> 00:54:24.300
that my life has felt
in a long time.

1268
00:54:24.433 --> 00:54:27.367
Is it hard for you going through
all the storage boxes?

1269
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.300
I mean, there must be
a lot of memories.

1270
00:54:31.066 --> 00:54:33.967
Yeah, it is.

1271
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.567
I thought I could come back here

1272
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.033
and just breeze through
everything in a couple of days,

1273
00:54:38.166 --> 00:54:40.133
never look back.

1274
00:54:42.033 --> 00:54:44.266
Well, the past has a way of
getting to you.

1275
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.934
Yes, it does.

1276
00:54:47.066 --> 00:54:49.700
I don't think I realized that
until I came back.

1277
00:54:49.834 --> 00:54:52.734
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

1278
00:54:52.867 --> 00:54:56.734
It's a good thing, definitely.

1279
00:54:58.767 --> 00:55:00.600
Yeah, I mean,
if you think about it,

1280
00:55:00.734 --> 00:55:02.100
if you had never come back,

1281
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:04.033
you never would have discovered
the dog cookies,

1282
00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:06.467
and a new diet, a whole new
perspective on life.

1283
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.266
Exactly.

1284
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.100
Soon I'm going to need one of
those cozy little dog beds.

1285
00:55:10.233 --> 00:55:11.333
Settle right in.

1286
00:55:13.133 --> 00:55:15.433
So Ed called,
he's going to drop by.

1287
00:55:15.567 --> 00:55:17.300
Just right about now, actually,

1288
00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:19.033
so I'm gonna get in there
and make some tea.

1289
00:55:19.166 --> 00:55:20.867
Nana, am I sensing some
excitement?

1290
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.533
Maybe a little bit of a crush?

1291
00:55:22.667 --> 00:55:25.867
What?! No, don't be so silly.
I'm too old for a crush.

1292
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.166
Hey, no one's ever too old
for a crush.

1293
00:55:30.233 --> 00:55:31.633
Besides, it has been five years.

1294
00:55:31.767 --> 00:55:34.133
I suppose it has.

1295
00:55:34.266 --> 00:55:35.767
- Have you seen this?!
- No, what?

1296
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.600
People are protesting in front
of Rachel's office!

1297
00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.333
They're furious
that we have to get out,

1298
00:55:39.467 --> 00:55:41.633
they're appealing to the mayor.

1299
00:55:41.767 --> 00:55:43.367
Okay, this is what we need.

1300
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.533
Right, I'm gonna go
make some tea.

1301
00:55:47.567 --> 00:55:48.667
Ed's coming.

1302
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.934
Right.

1303
00:55:50.066 --> 00:55:51.834
Not Edward. Ed.

1304
00:55:51.967 --> 00:55:53.133
Ed.

1305
00:55:53.266 --> 00:55:54.367
She has such a crush on him.

1306
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.333
That's a lot of cookies.

1307
00:56:02.467 --> 00:56:03.667
Are you planning on
buttering him up?

1308
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.233
I-- oh, do you think?

1309
00:56:06.367 --> 00:56:08.000
Well, I know that he has
a sweet tooth.

1310
00:56:08.133 --> 00:56:09.367
Oh really?

1311
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.500
Oh, you... Oh.

1312
00:56:12.633 --> 00:56:13.967
Hello, ladies.

1313
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.467
Lilly: Hi! Hello.

1314
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.333
Oh, are those for me?

1315
00:56:18.467 --> 00:56:20.433
Oh, these? Oh, no.
I brought these for Indie. Yeah.

1316
00:56:20.567 --> 00:56:22.300
And the other dogs.

1317
00:56:22.433 --> 00:56:23.800
Don't want to make anybody jealous.

1318
00:56:23.934 --> 00:56:26.834
Oh, you are such a kidder.
There you go.

1319
00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:28.934
Oh, those are beautiful.
Thank you!

1320
00:56:29.066 --> 00:56:30.433
Oh my.

1321
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:31.800
We made sandwiches,
I hope you're hungry.

1322
00:56:31.934 --> 00:56:34.000
Oh, this looks wonderful.
Thank you!

1323
00:56:34.133 --> 00:56:35.533
Oh, good.

1324
00:56:37.734 --> 00:56:40.000
So, I, uh,

1325
00:56:40.133 --> 00:56:44.433
got this from the lawyer
I met with yesterday.

1326
00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.100
She found some Stockard files.

1327
00:56:46.233 --> 00:56:48.567
But this was
the only thing in there

1328
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.600
pertaining to the severance.

1329
00:56:50.734 --> 00:56:53.266
It's just a rough, hand-drawn
plan for the severance.

1330
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.100
So then there was an agreement,
or at least an intention.

1331
00:56:56.233 --> 00:56:57.667
Yes.

1332
00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.567
Well, if she found this,
maybe there's other files.

1333
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.800
Well, I did ask her to look,
and she will.

1334
00:57:02.934 --> 00:57:05.300
Is there any chance we can
do another search at City Hall?

1335
00:57:05.433 --> 00:57:07.033
They already did, Bella.

1336
00:57:07.166 --> 00:57:10.867
Unfortunately, there was a fire
at the land registry office

1337
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.633
around the same time
this transaction occurred.

1338
00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:15.734
A lot of documents were lost.

1339
00:57:15.867 --> 00:57:18.200
So there's no hope
of finding it?

1340
00:57:18.333 --> 00:57:20.734
Well, the lawyer is going to
continue searching.

1341
00:57:20.867 --> 00:57:23.400
And we still have a lot to look
through, and JR is looking.

1342
00:57:23.533 --> 00:57:25.133
So we'll find it.

1343
00:57:25.266 --> 00:57:26.800
Yeah, yeah.

1344
00:57:26.934 --> 00:57:29.300
Do you mind if I take that
over to show JR?

1345
00:57:29.433 --> 00:57:31.533
Oh, not at all.
I've spoken to him, it's fine.

1346
00:57:31.667 --> 00:57:33.033
Yeah. There you go.

1347
00:57:33.166 --> 00:57:34.800
Okay.

1348
00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:37.800
I'll take this over to him now.
You two enjoy your lunch.

1349
00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:39.333
Oh, thank you!

1350
00:57:39.467 --> 00:57:40.667
Yes, thank you.

1351
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.166
Uh, well, dig in.

1352
00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.500
Well...

1353
00:57:48.967 --> 00:57:50.400
Come on.

1354
00:57:55.266 --> 00:57:56.400
Hey.

1355
00:57:56.533 --> 00:57:58.333
- Hi.
- Packing up already?

1356
00:57:58.467 --> 00:58:02.734
Um, just some additional files
the lawyers need.

1357
00:58:05.266 --> 00:58:07.200
Hi. Hi, booboo...

1358
00:58:07.333 --> 00:58:10.600
I guess I should have called.
Edward just dropped by,

1359
00:58:10.734 --> 00:58:13.934
and I wanted to come over and
show you the drawing.

1360
00:58:14.066 --> 00:58:16.233
Yeah, he called me
about this.

1361
00:58:22.266 --> 00:58:24.667
I guess it's just up to us now
to find it.

1362
00:58:26.033 --> 00:58:29.200
Is everything okay? I can go.

1363
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:30.300
No.

1364
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.033
I got an email
from my commanding officer.

1365
00:58:35.166 --> 00:58:38.100
I'm being recalled.
They're, uh...

1366
00:58:38.233 --> 00:58:40.467
They're sending me to Iraq.

1367
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.533
Iraq?

1368
00:58:42.667 --> 00:58:44.767
Wow. Um...

1369
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.233
When do you go?

1370
00:58:46.367 --> 00:58:51.066
Soon. Possibly within the week.

1371
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.867
I have a call tomorrow morning,
and I'll know more then.

1372
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.367
I, uh...

1373
00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.367
I knew you were leaving,
I guess I just forgot.

1374
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.367
I thought we had more time.

1375
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.367
I think part of me
kinda hoped you'd stay.

1376
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.967
When I first got back here,

1377
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.667
all I could think about
was leaving.

1378
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.133
The longer I've stayed,

1379
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:22.367
the longer it's really felt
like home.

1380
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.033
I guess I didn't take
your advice.

1381
00:59:26.166 --> 00:59:27.600
I got attached.

1382
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.867
Yeah. Um...

1383
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.567
But I didn't really listen to
my own advice, either.

1384
00:59:39.934 --> 00:59:41.266
I've gotta go.

1385
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.033
Bella, please. Please don't go.

1386
00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:46.867
JR... I don't want to make
a fool of myself.

1387
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.200
I'm not good at this.

1388
00:59:49.333 --> 00:59:53.533
Listen, I'm still here
for a few days.

1389
00:59:53.667 --> 00:59:56.600
I'm going to make sure that
everyone who committed

1390
00:59:56.734 --> 00:59:58.533
to a sponsorship follows through.

1391
00:59:58.667 --> 01:00:00.166
If that document is here,

1392
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.600
I still have boxes to go
through, I'm gonna find it.

1393
01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.700
Thanks.

1394
01:00:05.834 --> 01:00:07.367
That means a lot.

1395
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.767
Come on.

1396
01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:31.934
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering where you were.

1397
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.266
What's wrong, sweetie?

1398
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.300
Nothing.

1399
01:00:38.433 --> 01:00:40.700
Really, and how long
have I known you?

1400
01:00:40.834 --> 01:00:42.533
Too long, apparently.

1401
01:00:43.934 --> 01:00:47.333
Look, I know a sad face
when I see one.

1402
01:00:47.467 --> 01:00:49.200
Does this have something
to do with JR?

1403
01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.533
No.

1404
01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:53.066
Maybe.

1405
01:00:55.433 --> 01:00:58.000
Look, I know that
you've been hurt before,

1406
01:00:58.133 --> 01:01:00.233
but you can't hang onto
that forever.

1407
01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:02.000
Sometimes...

1408
01:01:02.133 --> 01:01:05.233
I don't know, you just have to
let go and trust somebody.

1409
01:01:05.367 --> 01:01:06.734
I know.

1410
01:01:06.867 --> 01:01:08.567
And I have.

1411
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.233
But I can't just give my heart
to someone who's leaving.

1412
01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:15.200
Sorry, sweetie.

1413
01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:17.066
I just have
stronger feelings for him

1414
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.734
than I ever could have imagined.

1415
01:01:20.867 --> 01:01:24.266
I really didn't want that
to happen.

1416
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.567
Yeah, well,

1417
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.100
that's what love does,
doesn't it?

1418
01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:31.200
Sometimes the heart
just chooses its own path.

1419
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.600
Yeah.

1420
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.734
Thanks for coming over
on such short notice.

1421
01:01:42.867 --> 01:01:44.233
Yeah, no problem.

1422
01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.700
Let's just hope
we can find this.

1423
01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:48.400
I hope so.

1424
01:01:48.533 --> 01:01:51.333
It's the last thing I can do
for Bella before I leave.

1425
01:01:51.467 --> 01:01:54.400
I guess Iraq was a deal breaker?

1426
01:01:54.533 --> 01:01:57.934
That and I'm out of here
before the end of the week.

1427
01:01:59.867 --> 01:02:02.066
You're gonna crush her heart,
you know.

1428
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.066
Look, I've known her
a long time, and...

1429
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.133
She's avoided relationships.

1430
01:02:09.266 --> 01:02:11.233
Then you came along.

1431
01:02:20.633 --> 01:02:21.500
- Hey.
- Hi.

1432
01:02:21.633 --> 01:02:23.000
Hi.

1433
01:02:23.133 --> 01:02:25.633
Surprised to see you here.

1434
01:02:25.767 --> 01:02:27.667
Especially without Indie.

1435
01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.967
It's been, what, a day,

1436
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.233
and I miss her already.

1437
01:02:31.367 --> 01:02:34.467
Yeah, I'm sure
she misses you too.

1438
01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.333
Yeah. Do you want to grab a
coffee or something?

1439
01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:40.133
Uh, I was actually just
going to head over to City Hall

1440
01:02:40.266 --> 01:02:41.834
to check the land registry.

1441
01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:44.266
I want to make sure
nothing was overlooked.

1442
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.266
Chad came over last night.

1443
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.000
We were up almost all night.

1444
01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.400
We went through all the rest
of the boxes.

1445
01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:54.800
Any luck?

1446
01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:57.100
I'm sorry.

1447
01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:59.266
Well, I still have some of my
Grandpa's stuff

1448
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.367
to go through, so...

1449
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.233
There's still a little glimmer
of hope.

1450
01:03:05.367 --> 01:03:06.800
Maybe I can--

1451
01:03:06.934 --> 01:03:09.467
Maybe I can come over later
and help you?

1452
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.233
Um...

1453
01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:14.900
Yeah, I-- I don't think
that's the best idea.

1454
01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:17.400
It's just going to confuse
Indie, so...

1455
01:03:17.533 --> 01:03:21.700
Right, of course.

1456
01:03:21.834 --> 01:03:23.367
How are things going with
her adoption?

1457
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.367
Good, good.

1458
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.233
Yeah, we... we had a lot of
interest after the TV show,

1459
01:03:28.367 --> 01:03:29.567
so I should be able
to get her placed

1460
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.533
in the next couple of days,

1461
01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.333
which will be
the best thing for her.

1462
01:03:33.467 --> 01:03:36.300
Especially with the move
coming up.

1463
01:03:36.433 --> 01:03:40.166
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

1464
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.800
Do you want a ride to City Hall?

1465
01:03:41.934 --> 01:03:44.000
I'm just parked back there.

1466
01:03:44.133 --> 01:03:46.467
City Hall is right there.

1467
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.200
Yes. Yes, I knew that.

1468
01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:51.867
I absolutely knew that.

1469
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.867
It was, um,

1470
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.467
it was nice to see you, JR.

1471
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.900
Yeah.

1472
01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:06.867
Grandpa kept absolutely everything.

1473
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.633
Yes, except for the one thing
we need, apparently.

1474
01:04:10.767 --> 01:04:14.066
Well, at least all this purging
will make moving easier.

1475
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.166
Thanks for staying so positive, Maddie.

1476
01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.467
This came in this morning.

1477
01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.166
Thought you might want
to see it.

1478
01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.900
Oh.

1479
01:04:23.967 --> 01:04:25.133
Lily:
Come on in, JR!

1480
01:04:25.266 --> 01:04:26.667
Come on in.

1481
01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:33.333
- Hi.
- Lily: Hi.

1482
01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:34.967
Hey.

1483
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.567
Hi, girl. Hello.

1484
01:04:39.867 --> 01:04:41.867
Maddie, do you want to help me
put the dogs to bed?

1485
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.600
- Yes.
- It's time.

1486
01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:46.300
It's way past their bedtime.

1487
01:04:46.433 --> 01:04:48.133
Come on, sweetie.
Good to see you.

1488
01:04:48.266 --> 01:04:49.367
You too.

1489
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.633
Lily:
See you guys later.

1490
01:04:50.767 --> 01:04:51.900
Good night, Lily.

1491
01:04:52.033 --> 01:04:53.633
- Good night.
- 'Night.

1492
01:04:59.367 --> 01:05:03.667
I know.
I know that it's a bad idea.

1493
01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:06.700
Nana called you, didn't she?

1494
01:05:07.734 --> 01:05:10.066
Perhaps.

1495
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.400
She said you have a lot to do.
Let me help.

1496
01:05:14.533 --> 01:05:17.800
I'd really appreciate that.
Thank you.

1497
01:05:45.033 --> 01:05:47.300
Well, uh...

1498
01:05:47.433 --> 01:05:50.567
now I know why
she loves you so much.

1499
01:05:58.367 --> 01:06:00.300
Do you want me to go?

1500
01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.567
No.

1501
01:06:04.734 --> 01:06:07.500
I'm really glad you're here.

1502
01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:10.567
Stay. We'll go through
all of this, okay?

1503
01:06:13.633 --> 01:06:15.233
Oh...

1504
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.700
More pictures?

1505
01:06:28.934 --> 01:06:30.967
I was very skinny
and I had black hair.

1506
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.133
It was not...

1507
01:06:33.266 --> 01:06:34.700
You know what?
It grew back.

1508
01:06:36.934 --> 01:06:40.166
This was a great shirt.

1509
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.166
Can I see?

1510
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.266
Yeah.

1511
01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:10.567
Oh my.

1512
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.867
Have you been up all night?

1513
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.734
Well, there was a...

1514
01:07:14.867 --> 01:07:16.934
There was a lot to search through.

1515
01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:18.867
And you didn't find anything?

1516
01:07:20.367 --> 01:07:23.867
No, there's nothing here
on the severance.

1517
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.500
Well, if it's not here,
and it's not at the lawyer's,

1518
01:07:27.633 --> 01:07:29.233
there's just one more
place to look,

1519
01:07:29.367 --> 01:07:31.367
and that's your house, JR.

1520
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.967
And you've looked through
everything?

1521
01:07:35.033 --> 01:07:36.533
Yeah.

1522
01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:40.100
If those papers were there,
I would have found them.

1523
01:07:40.233 --> 01:07:42.233
I'm so sorry, Lily.

1524
01:07:42.367 --> 01:07:44.233
Well, then I guess we just have
to face the facts

1525
01:07:44.367 --> 01:07:46.266
that it's all over.

1526
01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:53.000
I'll make you guys some coffee,
okay?

1527
01:07:57.033 --> 01:07:59.834
You did everything
you could, JR.

1528
01:08:02.433 --> 01:08:04.600
So what happens now?

1529
01:08:04.734 --> 01:08:06.734
What happens to Indie?

1530
01:08:06.867 --> 01:08:10.633
Uh, well, I have some temporary
foster homes for the dogs,

1531
01:08:10.767 --> 01:08:14.467
and, uh, Indie will stay with me
until we can relocate,

1532
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.500
unless she's adopted.

1533
01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.899
That's gonna be
really hard on her,

1534
01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:20.133
she's very attached to you.

1535
01:08:20.265 --> 01:08:22.265
Yeah.

1536
01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.166
She's even more attached to you.

1537
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.233
Well, I should get going.

1538
01:08:30.367 --> 01:08:32.433
I've got some personal stuff
I have to pack up.

1539
01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:36.066
Okay.

1540
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.000
Um, what are you going to do
with everything in the house?

1541
01:08:39.133 --> 01:08:41.233
There's a lot of stuff there.

1542
01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:45.166
Yeah, well, I'll have the movers
pack everything up

1543
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.133
and move it into storage

1544
01:08:47.265 --> 01:08:49.934
until I figure out what
I'm doing.

1545
01:08:50.066 --> 01:08:52.233
Good, good.

1546
01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:57.934
Bella, can I see you again
before I leave?

1547
01:09:02.433 --> 01:09:04.700
JR...

1548
01:09:04.834 --> 01:09:06.500
I can't do this.

1549
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.899
I promised myself that I would
never let anyone

1550
01:09:10.033 --> 01:09:11.166
break my heart again.

1551
01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.533
Bella, I...

1552
01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:15.166
I hear you.

1553
01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.966
But please, I've never felt
like this before,

1554
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.899
and just please tell me
that we can talk about this.

1555
01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:22.600
There's got to be something
we can do.

1556
01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:27.567
What's the point?

1557
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.899
I mean, you said it yourself.

1558
01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:33.734
Long distance relationships
are too hard.

1559
01:09:33.867 --> 01:09:37.466
So what, we're just
going to drag this out longer?

1560
01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:43.233
I think, um,

1561
01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:45.899
I think maybe it's best
if you go.

1562
01:09:52.466 --> 01:09:53.433
Okay.

1563
01:10:09.033 --> 01:10:11.300
Yes.

1564
01:10:11.433 --> 01:10:12.400
Yeah. Yeah.

1565
01:10:12.533 --> 01:10:15.567
I know.

1566
01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:03.633
Ah! Yes! Edward, it's JR.

1567
01:11:03.767 --> 01:11:05.033
...really glad...

1568
01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:06.800
These are the architects
I told you about.

1569
01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:08.767
Excellent, would you just
give me a moment?

1570
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.100
Sure. Why don't you guys
start in the kitchen?

1571
01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:11.567
Thank you. Okay.

1572
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.400
Listen, I have found
something that I think

1573
01:11:13.533 --> 01:11:15.967
you'll really want to see.

1574
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.533
Yes, I am--
I am very excited.

1575
01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:22.033
If it's okay with you, I'd love
to come over right away

1576
01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.700
and show it to you.
Are you-- are you free?

1577
01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.967
Yes? Great.

1578
01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.467
Excellent, okay.

1579
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.367
All right, okay, bye.

1580
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.400
Sorry, I didn't realize that we
had a meeting today.

1581
01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:37.133
Yeah, we did.

1582
01:11:37.266 --> 01:11:40.900
Um, if you don't mind, something
important has popped up.

1583
01:11:41.033 --> 01:11:43.233
Is it all right if I leave you
here to do your measuring?

1584
01:11:43.367 --> 01:11:44.800
No problem.

1585
01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.967
Hey, I'll talk to you before you
leave for your tour.

1586
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:47.967
Yes, you will.

1587
01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.500
- Okay.
- Bye.

1588
01:11:54.867 --> 01:11:56.233
JR, come on in.

1589
01:11:56.367 --> 01:12:00.834
Thank you.

1590
01:12:00.967 --> 01:12:04.266
So, you're on your way?

1591
01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.867
Looks like it. Yeah.

1592
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.033
These past few weeks have been
a roller coaster ride.

1593
01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:12.967
Changed my life, really.

1594
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.467
This is about Bella, isn't it?

1595
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.667
She's the most amazing woman
I've ever met.

1596
01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.333
Well, sometimes these things
happen to us

1597
01:12:22.467 --> 01:12:23.767
when we least expect it.

1598
01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:25.600
Yes they do,

1599
01:12:25.734 --> 01:12:28.767
and now I'm
up against the wall.

1600
01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.333
On the one hand,

1601
01:12:30.467 --> 01:12:33.700
I've got the woman that
I've completely fallen for,

1602
01:12:33.834 --> 01:12:35.266
and on the other,

1603
01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.367
the career that's been the
mainstay of my life.

1604
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.000
Well, couldn't you have both?

1605
01:12:39.133 --> 01:12:41.300
Not in this case.

1606
01:12:41.433 --> 01:12:44.033
Bella deserves somebody
who's there for her,

1607
01:12:44.166 --> 01:12:47.000
present, in her life.

1608
01:12:47.133 --> 01:12:50.300
I guess I'm just not that man.

1609
01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:52.600
I'm sorry to hear that, JR.

1610
01:12:52.734 --> 01:12:56.467
I guess sometimes things
don't work out the way we plan.

1611
01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.934
Sometimes they do.

1612
01:12:59.066 --> 01:13:00.266
I found the severance papers

1613
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.000
that we've all been
searching for.

1614
01:13:02.133 --> 01:13:03.767
I figured if I can't be
here with Bella,

1615
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.567
at least I can do something
to save the center.

1616
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:09.266
That is the best news
I've heard in a long while.

1617
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.367
Lily is going to be so relieved.

1618
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It's not here.
That doesn't make any sense.

1619
01:13:17.133 --> 01:13:18.333
It was right on top.

1620
01:13:18.467 --> 01:13:19.533
Are you sure?

1621
01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:21.834
Yes, it was marked
"Stockard copy."

1622
01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:24.900
Please don't tell me I've lost
it after all this.

1623
01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:28.000
How could I have lost it?

1624
01:13:29.834 --> 01:13:31.767
I don't believe it.

1625
01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.066
There is another copy.
It's Lily's.

1626
01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.166
Take a look.

1627
01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.200
Ed:
Looks like the real deal.

1628
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.834
You can make sure
it gets to Bella?

1629
01:13:41.967 --> 01:13:44.367
Can't you deliver it yourself?

1630
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.033
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1631
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.567
When are you on your way?

1632
01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.166
Today. No sense sticking around.

1633
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.367
JR, uh,

1634
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.767
one of the things I've learned
in this life

1635
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.900
is that love is precious.

1636
01:14:03.033 --> 01:14:05.266
And if you're lucky enough
to find it, my friend,

1637
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.367
never let it go.

1638
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.000
Rachel. Hi.
What a surprise.

1639
01:14:25.133 --> 01:14:27.667
That's me,
always full of surprises.

1640
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.834
Can I give you a tour?

1641
01:14:29.967 --> 01:14:32.300
Yeah, I'm not so comfortable
with dogs.

1642
01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:34.800
Well, I'd happily give you a
tour of our indoor facilities.

1643
01:14:34.934 --> 01:14:36.467
Most of the dogs are out for
their walks right now.

1644
01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.834
No, it's fine.

1645
01:14:37.967 --> 01:14:39.166
In a few weeks,
it will all be bulldozed,

1646
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.300
so it doesn't really matter.

1647
01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:43.166
Uh, what about the extension?

1648
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.000
The extension?

1649
01:14:45.133 --> 01:14:47.066
Didn't JR talk to you about it?

1650
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.467
Oh, that.

1651
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.767
Rachel, if we could
just have six months,

1652
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.000
it would be so helpful.

1653
01:14:53.133 --> 01:14:55.900
Yeah, I was just talking
to JR about it.

1654
01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:57.900
As a matter of fact,
I just came from his house.

1655
01:14:58.033 --> 01:15:00.900
We have a lot of big decisions
to make now,

1656
01:15:01.033 --> 01:15:02.667
and we both decided that

1657
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.200
it's really not in the best
interest for the business.

1658
01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:08.000
I'm so sorry.

1659
01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:10.633
You've both decided?

1660
01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:12.200
Of course.

1661
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:15.033
Oh, I've asked JR
to come into business with me.

1662
01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:17.967
I think we'll make a
fabulous team.

1663
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.467
Isn't he going to Iraq?

1664
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.467
Yeah, but I don't mind a
little challenge.

1665
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.567
Oh! I have a little donation
for you.

1666
01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.734
To help you with the move.
It's the least I can do.

1667
01:15:27.867 --> 01:15:31.667
And I can have my people
arrange a truck.

1668
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.333
I'm sorry. Is this a joke?

1669
01:15:34.467 --> 01:15:36.533
I'm just trying
to be generous, Bella,

1670
01:15:36.667 --> 01:15:39.000
do my part
for the rescue center.

1671
01:15:40.033 --> 01:15:42.900
I don't want your money, Rachel.

1672
01:15:43.033 --> 01:15:44.800
Please get off my property.

1673
01:15:46.433 --> 01:15:48.667
And don't think that your little
game with the protestors

1674
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.834
will save you.
It's too late for that.

1675
01:15:51.867 --> 01:15:53.567
Good luck with the move.

1676
01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:02.600
Oh, would you mind just taking
those over to the raffle booth?

1677
01:16:02.734 --> 01:16:03.700
Thanks.

1678
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.734
Hey, I didn't see JR
around today.

1679
01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:08.567
I thought he would come over
to help set up for tomorrow.

1680
01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.700
Uh, yeah, he's not coming.

1681
01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:14.533
Not coming? Why?

1682
01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:16.734
He got a new assignment.

1683
01:16:16.867 --> 01:16:18.767
He's leaving for Iraq.

1684
01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.867
Iraq?

1685
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.800
Oh my gosh.
How are you doing?

1686
01:16:24.266 --> 01:16:26.767
I just feel like
I should have known better.

1687
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.967
But I still let myself...

1688
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.500
Fall in love?

1689
01:16:32.867 --> 01:16:34.834
Bella... come here.

1690
01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:49.967
Come here, Eddie. Come on.

1691
01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.400
Yes...

1692
01:16:51.533 --> 01:16:53.767
There you go...

1693
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.900
Come here. Good boy.

1694
01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:59.066
Good boy. Good boy.

1695
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.100
You need me to do anything
before I leave tonight?

1696
01:17:01.233 --> 01:17:03.934
Um, no. I think we're good.

1697
01:17:04.066 --> 01:17:05.767
Okay, see you first thing tomorrow.

1698
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.700
Sounds good.
Have a good night.

1699
01:17:09.066 --> 01:17:10.166
Maddie:
Good night, Lily.

1700
01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.867
Good night, honey.

1701
01:17:14.467 --> 01:17:15.767
Tomorrow is our big day.

1702
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.200
The most exciting day
of the year.

1703
01:17:23.233 --> 01:17:25.967
Oh, it's hard to think
about leaving.

1704
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.934
Your grandfather built
this place.

1705
01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:30.700
He really loved it here,
didn't he?

1706
01:17:30.834 --> 01:17:32.967
Yeah.

1707
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.300
You know,
we started very small,

1708
01:17:35.433 --> 01:17:37.867
and nothing made him happier
than building more space

1709
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.800
to accommodate more dogs.

1710
01:17:42.834 --> 01:17:44.934
Well, you built a really
beautiful place here.

1711
01:17:45.066 --> 01:17:46.767
We sure did.

1712
01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.400
And a pretty beautiful life together.

1713
01:17:52.233 --> 01:17:54.834
Now it's time
to say goodbye.

1714
01:17:54.967 --> 01:17:56.300
Not to just this place,

1715
01:17:56.433 --> 01:17:58.700
but to your grandfather.

1716
01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:02.500
I don't know if I'm ready
to do that, sweetie.

1717
01:18:02.633 --> 01:18:04.200
Oh, Nana.

1718
01:18:04.333 --> 01:18:07.433
Everything here
is a piece of him.

1719
01:18:09.233 --> 01:18:11.433
He'll still be watching
over you.

1720
01:18:12.834 --> 01:18:15.033
Yeah, I believe he will.

1721
01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:25.533
We're gonna get through this.
You and me.

1722
01:18:27.567 --> 01:18:29.834
The Rachels of the world
better watch out.

1723
01:18:29.967 --> 01:18:31.567
Yeah.

1724
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.767
'Cause we're a fierce team.

1725
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.900
Yeah.

1726
01:18:36.033 --> 01:18:37.166
I love you.

1727
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.333
I love you too, kiddo.

1728
01:18:38.467 --> 01:18:39.967
Thanks.

1729
01:18:57.033 --> 01:19:00.667
Make sure you come out today to
Pooches in the Park

1730
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.100
to support
Bella's Rescue Center.

1731
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.767
Hi, fellas! Hi, Ethan!

1732
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.667
- Hi.
- Hi, Willow.

1733
01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.834
How are you enjoying
having her?

1734
01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:23.100
I really love Willow.

1735
01:19:23.233 --> 01:19:25.467
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.

1736
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.967
I'll catch up with you guys
in a little bit,

1737
01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.600
I'm just going to do my rounds.

1738
01:19:28.734 --> 01:19:29.600
Hi.

1739
01:19:29.734 --> 01:19:30.967
Hey.

1740
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.066
Thank you guys so much
for coming.

1741
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.834
I'm so glad you guys are here.

1742
01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:37.900
Well, you two enjoy the day.
I'll run around a little bit,

1743
01:19:38.033 --> 01:19:39.233
but I'll catch up with you
in a bit.

1744
01:19:39.367 --> 01:19:40.233
No problem.

1745
01:19:40.367 --> 01:19:41.333
Okay.

1746
01:19:43.133 --> 01:19:44.433
Hey, Bella.

1747
01:19:44.567 --> 01:19:46.100
Hi!

1748
01:19:46.233 --> 01:19:47.767
Are you all ready?

1749
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.400
Oh, as ready as I'm gonna be.

1750
01:19:49.533 --> 01:19:51.333
- You?
- Absolutely.

1751
01:19:51.467 --> 01:19:52.967
I've done a few interviews already

1752
01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.266
and the people are raving
about the adoptions.

1753
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.100
Oh, that makes me so happy
to hear that.

1754
01:19:57.233 --> 01:19:58.600
Especially your soldier.

1755
01:19:58.734 --> 01:20:00.633
She said when she returned
from Afghanistan,

1756
01:20:00.767 --> 01:20:02.600
her world turned upside down.

1757
01:20:02.734 --> 01:20:05.266
Her new little friend is helping
her deal with her PTSD

1758
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.834
and keeps her calm.

1759
01:20:06.967 --> 01:20:09.767
Ah, well, these dogs are
miracle workers.

1760
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.834
I've gotta get back to my
camera, I'll see you later.

1761
01:20:11.967 --> 01:20:14.600
Of course. Thanks, Jill.

1762
01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:19.333
Nana.

1763
01:20:19.467 --> 01:20:21.900
Oh, Bella, hi!

1764
01:20:22.033 --> 01:20:24.800
Look what you've achieved, huh?
Look at this.

1765
01:20:24.934 --> 01:20:26.300
Oh, well, it wasn't just me.

1766
01:20:26.433 --> 01:20:29.000
We're a team.
You, me, Maddie,

1767
01:20:29.133 --> 01:20:30.967
I could not have done this
by myself.

1768
01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:34.667
Well, you worked really hard and
you made this happen.

1769
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.066
And I have some really
good news.

1770
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.834
What?

1771
01:20:39.967 --> 01:20:42.967
Well, I think maybe Ed would
like to tell you himself.

1772
01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.433
Well, you remember that
long-lost document

1773
01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:49.400
that we were all searching
high and low for?

1774
01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:55.967
Where did you find this?

1775
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.533
JR found it.
He asked me to give it to you.

1776
01:21:01.033 --> 01:21:02.467
Does this mean
we don't have to move?

1777
01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.800
We don't have to move, Bella.

1778
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.367
Oh, honey!

1779
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.166
Oh...

1780
01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.834
Get in here!

1781
01:21:12.967 --> 01:21:14.400
Get in here! Oh dear.

1782
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.567
Listen to that music!

1783
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.133
That just makes me want to kick
up my heels.

1784
01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:21.367
- Well, okay?
- What do you think?

1785
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.633
I'm in!

1786
01:21:22.767 --> 01:21:24.500
Oh, what a day.
What a day!

1787
01:21:30.367 --> 01:21:32.700
Maddie!
I have the best news!

1788
01:21:32.834 --> 01:21:36.700
I know! Lily told me,
but I was sworn to secrecy.

1789
01:21:36.834 --> 01:21:38.633
Well, it could not have been
a better surprise.

1790
01:21:38.767 --> 01:21:39.834
I have something else
to tell you

1791
01:21:39.967 --> 01:21:41.200
but I have to go to the kennels.

1792
01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:43.700
- Yeah, I'll come with you.
- Okay.

1793
01:21:43.834 --> 01:21:46.800
So what was the thing
that you wanted to tell me?

1794
01:21:46.934 --> 01:21:49.967
I got an adoption application
for Indie.

1795
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:51.700
Oh.

1796
01:21:51.834 --> 01:21:53.667
Isn't that what
you wanted?

1797
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.500
Yeah, I guess.

1798
01:21:55.633 --> 01:21:57.367
But?

1799
01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.734
I'm-- I've just become really
attached to her.

1800
01:22:00.867 --> 01:22:02.967
It's gonna be hard
to let her go.

1801
01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.033
I know. I'm sorry.

1802
01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:07.567
It's okay, I knew in my heart
that this was gonna happen,

1803
01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.066
I'm just never really
prepared for it.

1804
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.367
Well, they're in the military,

1805
01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.767
and they've been here
a few times,

1806
01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.800
and they like Indie.

1807
01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:17.633
Okay.

1808
01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:19.900
Well, I'd like to meet them
before everything is finalized

1809
01:22:20.033 --> 01:22:21.734
to make sure Indie
is happy too.

1810
01:22:21.867 --> 01:22:24.533
Of course, and I was really
careful with the screening.

1811
01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:27.767
Okay. I'm just going to
take a second.

1812
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.867
Okay.

1813
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.266
Hi.

1814
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.367
Hey.

1815
01:22:47.533 --> 01:22:50.367
Wow, today is full of surprises.

1816
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.867
I just wanted to see you again.

1817
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.033
Well, I'm glad you're here.

1818
01:22:56.166 --> 01:22:59.900
Thank you for finding this,
for saving the center.

1819
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.333
How's everything going with
the fundraising?

1820
01:23:02.467 --> 01:23:03.834
Uh, good, yeah.

1821
01:23:03.967 --> 01:23:06.667
Sponsorships and donations
are over the moon,

1822
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.700
thanks, in a weird way,
to your new partner, Rachel.

1823
01:23:10.834 --> 01:23:13.166
What? Partner?

1824
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.300
Yeah, she stopped by yesterday
to tell me

1825
01:23:15.433 --> 01:23:17.900
that you're going
into business together.

1826
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.834
Wow, okay, that's not true.

1827
01:23:22.967 --> 01:23:24.767
Actually, when Rachel found out
that the sale

1828
01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.767
no longer included the center,
she threatened to back out.

1829
01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.033
She wanted me to destroy the
severance papers.

1830
01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:34.700
I said no, I wouldn't do that,
and she walked.

1831
01:23:34.834 --> 01:23:36.433
I'm keeping the company.

1832
01:23:37.567 --> 01:23:39.200
Wow.

1833
01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:41.166
JR, that's great.

1834
01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.467
I'm sure your parents
would be really proud of you.

1835
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.200
Um, listen, good luck in Iraq.

1836
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.200
I'm really glad I met you.

1837
01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:54.100
Who knows, maybe one day
we'll see each other again.

1838
01:23:54.233 --> 01:23:55.467
Bella.

1839
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.000
A very wise man
recently told me something

1840
01:23:57.133 --> 01:23:58.700
that really opened my eyes.

1841
01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:00.533
He said that if you're ever
lucky enough to find love,

1842
01:24:00.667 --> 01:24:02.200
don't ever let it go.

1843
01:24:05.233 --> 01:24:07.433
Bella, I love you.

1844
01:24:07.567 --> 01:24:09.033
With all my heart.

1845
01:24:10.667 --> 01:24:12.033
JR...

1846
01:24:13.233 --> 01:24:15.100
I can't say it back.

1847
01:24:16.166 --> 01:24:17.700
You're leaving,

1848
01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:19.500
and it's just going to make my
heart break even more.

1849
01:24:19.633 --> 01:24:21.667
I'm not leaving.

1850
01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.767
You-- you're not?

1851
01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.333
I requested a transfer to
the local reserves.

1852
01:24:26.467 --> 01:24:29.600
The paperwork is being processed
right now.

1853
01:24:29.734 --> 01:24:31.500
Are you sure that's what
you want?

1854
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.266
I've never been more sure of
anything for my entire life.

1855
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.800
Because I'm in love with you.

1856
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.000
I love you too.

1857
01:24:59.133 --> 01:25:00.800
Just one more thing.

1858
01:25:00.934 --> 01:25:02.266
I adopted a dog.

1859
01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.500
Hi.

1860
01:25:07.633 --> 01:25:09.333
Thanks, Maddie.

1861
01:25:10.734 --> 01:25:13.166
Good girl.

1862
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.500
I couldn't leave her either,

1863
01:25:14.633 --> 01:25:17.734
so I'm here to stay.

1864
01:25:17.867 --> 01:25:20.333
For you, for Indie.

1865
01:25:20.467 --> 01:25:23.200
For us, if you'll have me.

1866
01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:25.900
Of course I'll have you.

1867
01:25:26.033 --> 01:25:26.900
Yeah?

1868
01:25:27.033 --> 01:25:28.000
Yeah!
