4
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.469
When I think of

5
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.682
science fiction, I think of
stories in any medium

6
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.852
that tell us what we could be

7
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.647
and warn us about where we're going.

8
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.233
Every piece of science fiction

9
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:53.238
that I enjoy works as pure entertainment,

10
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.033
and it also works as a social commentary,

11
00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.537
philosophy or inspirational ideas.

12
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.916
It was always a genre that carried with it

13
00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.753
a sense of taking the
temperature of its own times.

14
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.215
It's a ripe genre, it's
full of interesting

15
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.968
twists and offshoots.

16
00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.423
I can get you deseases.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

17
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:23.894
There are so many subgenres
that are available to us

18
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.772
and I think really give
this kind of rich landscape.

19
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:34.279
Science fiction storytelling
exists from the beginning

20
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:37.365
of filmmaking and persists through

21
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.867
two centuries.

22
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.577
Images

23
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:45.123
that we see in cinema
today are built on images from movies

24
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.877
like 2001, a space odyssey,
Metropolis and things to come.

25
00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.879
In the '50s,

26
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.675
sci fi was an extension of science,
and science was all about the atom,

27
00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.427
and the atom was all about,
they're going to blow us up

28
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.765
or we're going to have a wonderful future
because of our friend of the atom.

29
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.144
The people doing these science
fiction films in the '803,

30
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:10.607
they cut their teeth on '50s sci fi,

31
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.694
but what they did is they said,
we love sci fi for what it represents.

32
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:19.448
The post atomic scare that stimulated
so many of these low budget Saturday

33
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.075
matinee type movies.

34
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.411
They really impacted us as children.

35
00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:27.833
But in a different way than
films now in the '703,

36
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:32.504
films tend to be more socially conscious,
more artistically presented.

37
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.257
But let's take a b movie

38
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:39.177
and just do it as though we're doing
an art film, without a happy ending.

39
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.141
The twist

40
00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:47.853
towards the dark, nihilistic sci fi,
I think, was largely a response against

41
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.524
technology, government, war,
especially in the Vietnam era.

42
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.776
A lot of those dystopian films

43
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.613
were warning about global warming

44
00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.825
and the arms race.

45
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.827
You maniacs! You blew it up!

46
00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.874
Things that I think made
people feel very small

47
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:13.002
and very out of control.
And that seems to really be

48
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:16.173
what science fiction is about
until star wars.

49
00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.473
The whole tone of science fiction
and films really changes

50
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.476
with Lucas and Spielberg
in the '703 and '80s,

51
00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:32.354
and it starts showing us the
positive possibilities in our world

52
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.692
as opposed to constantly warning us
about all the ways we're messing up.

53
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.529
Spielberg said, "can't we go back to what

54
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.325
I grew up with, which is the beauty
of sci fl and imagination?

55
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.620
Let's not dwell on the corrupting
influence of technology."

56
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.003
For the next decade
or so across the '803,

57
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.049
that amalgamation of science, fiction,

58
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:02.469
and fantasy, seemed to be
the driving force.

59
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.014
Science fiction became direct,

60
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.601
straightfonnard, provocative, clear.

61
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.106
Any idea that anybody had
if you set it on another planet or

62
00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.778
set it in the future, set it in dystopia,
you could get the money to do it.

63
00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.615
Now, sci fi was viable box office.

64
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:28.745
And now the studios are
throwing money at the genre

65
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.873
and you're getting the best filmmakers
and the best actors,

66
00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.960
and they have the funds
to take you to other places.

67
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.255
Sci fi truly came of age and exploded

68
00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:39.923
in the '80s.

69
00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:02.279
We are creating machines
that mimic human behavior.

70
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:05.073
The human body, human intelligence.

71
00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:10.077
In saturn 3, you see
the biomimicry of Hector,

72
00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:14.666
the machine taking on its human
creators ideas and psychopathy.

73
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:21.882
Certainly, the way

74
00:06:21.883 --> 00:06:25.844
saturn 3 was sold, leaned
heavily on alien, robot, science.

75
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.638
All that kind of stuff, but it leaned
even more heavily on Farrah fawcett

76
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.683
and that absolutely stunning smile of hers,
in the fact that all of us

77
00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.020
were enamored of Farrah
from Charlie's angels.

78
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.188
I had that poster,
everybody had that poster.

79
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.859
And the idea that Farrah fawcett
might be wearing something sexy or

80
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.738
nothing at all, definitely got my
young self out to see saturn 3.

81
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.365
The movie you got, however,
was a completely different movie.

82
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.368
You're quite an event in our lives.

83
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.413
Well, I guess you don't
get many drop-ins on satrun 3.

84
00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.457
Hardly ever, especially
not from earth.

85
00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.791
We are on a space station that is slick,

86
00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.755
and designed and shiny and colorful,
and all the edges are smoothed out.

87
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.840
All of the ideas
that might have been initiated

88
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:08.761
by alien are gone by the time
you get to the finish product of saturn 3.

89
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.723
We get to see
kirk Douglas naked a lot,

90
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.477
but not Farrah fawcett.

91
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.813
That was kind of
fonnard thinking.

92
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.857
Doesn't it disgust you
to be used by him?

93
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.691
To be touched by an old man?

94
00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.692
Can't you feel the decay?

95
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.946
The notion that he wanted
to express his virility,

96
00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.467
that he's still a leading man,
that he was still an action star.

97
00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.661
Kirk Douglas was very particular
about that. About that in terms

98
00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:36.914
of the notion of of men, of male
movie stars and actors

99
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.876
and the way that they
should come off in film.

100
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:40.919
Abort!

101
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.507
Glad you didn't ask
him to shake hands.

102
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.591
It's a complicated film, you got

103
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.761
you got Stanley donen the singin'
in the rain director, directing

104
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:54.057
this sort of science fiction opera
with this crazy, oversexed robot.

105
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.686
No! No! No!

106
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.564
He's probably not the
right director for that.

107
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.526
The production designer, John Barry,
he was probably the correct person.

108
00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.445
The scenario was based on his stories.

109
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:12.033
But kirk didn't like John and so got him
fired and had Stanley donen hired.

110
00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.494
So you have kirk Douglas,
who doesn't like John Barry.

111
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:15.453
He gets rid of him.

112
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.057
And then you have Stanley donen,
who doesn't like Harvey keitel's voice.

113
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.123
Now we have this weird

114
00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:22.877
sort of quasi British voice
coming out of Harvey keitel's face.

115
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.380
Why won't you talk?

116
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.009
Why not? What have I done wrong?

117
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.219
All of these decisions just sort of led

118
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.183
to something of a mess of a movie,
except for Farrah fawcett.

119
00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.433
Kudos to Farrah fawcett

120
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.794
for dealing with all those boys
and what was going on there.

121
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.688
It just didn't seem to connect

122
00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:46.401
with the bigger universe
in the way that the star wars films had.

123
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:50.447
No, this was all stuff happening
on this space station

124
00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.241
between these people and a freaky robot.

125
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.077
Check me.

126
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.127
The whole star wars

127
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.881
experience is a phenomenon.

128
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.258
It opened up horizons in a way

129
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.344
that nobody ever imagined.

130
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.386
I'm going in.

131
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:16.890
I loved it

132
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.933
the force is strong with this one.

133
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.601
I always felt that George Lucas

134
00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.147
was a very unique individual
who had a unique point of view.

135
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.274
I often wondered if he knew

136
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:30.737
what he was really introducing.

137
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.781
The emprie strikes back

138
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.868
coming to your galaxy next summer.

139
00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:37.869
With lando,

140
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.540
I didn't want to make a black character,
or a white character. Lando was lando.

141
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.500
It's like Billy Dee to me is Billy Dee.

142
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.921
I want to show you my
own personal uniqueness.

143
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.927
How you doin', you old pirate?

144
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.677
It's so good to see you!

145
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.012
I wanted to talk about

146
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.390
a swashbuckling kind of individual.

147
00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.392
Welcome, Leia.

148
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.105
That was an honor, to work with kershner.

149
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:10.567
He was a real actor's director
for one thing, so he really understood

150
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.612
the human behavior.

151
00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.655
Well, your highness,
I guess this is it.

152
00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.658
That's right.

153
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:18.701
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

154
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.454
It wasn't just purely based on

155
00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.665
this kind of a journey into space.

156
00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.708
Punch it!

157
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.963
One of the great things

158
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.383
about playing a kind of
a dubious character.

159
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.554
They're not bad people,
they're just caught up in situations.

160
00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.057
I remember picking my
daughter from school,

161
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.978
and the kids would accuse
me of betraying hansel.

162
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.690
And I'm right in the
middle of the schoolyard

163
00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:51.734
having this debate with these kids.

164
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.777
I had no choice. They arrived
right before you did.

165
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.780
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:55.864 --> 00:11:00.243
If you express those characters
through a kind of vulnerability,

167
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:04.079
then I think it makes it more palatable

168
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.873
and much more interesting.

169
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.500
I am your father.

170
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.211
George wanted to keep everything secret,

171
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.006
he wanted everything
to be a surprise in the movie.

172
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:18.511
Unlike keri and Mark, who signed
contracts for multiple movies,

173
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:22.055
Harrison only signed for one movie,

174
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:26.269
and each movie was a separate contract
with him.

175
00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:30.606
George wasn't sure he would
come back for jedi.

176
00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:37.655
So that's why, at the end of empire,
Han Solo gets frozen in carbonite.

177
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.366
I love you.

178
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.784
I know.

179
00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.161
They needed a way, if Harrison

180
00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:48.875
didn't come back for the third movie,
how do you explain what happened?

181
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.628
But if he does come back, you defrost him,

182
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.547
and we're all happy.

183
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.262
George is more of an idea person,

184
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.557
that has these great,
fantastic visions.

185
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.144
And I was a little bit surprised
because he was talking about

186
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.980
the budget for empire strikes back.

187
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.773
And he was trying to figure out

188
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:17.070
how not to spend the more money than he
spent on the first star wars movie.

189
00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.114
I'm thinking this guy is this monolith

190
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.617
as far as creativity is concerned.

191
00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.701
But here's a guy thinking about

192
00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.580
how much money am I spending
to put an idea together.

193
00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.332
Yeah, it's show business.

194
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.168
Part of the pressure
that George was feeling

195
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.380
was because he had financed

196
00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:39.259
empire himself as opposed
to having a studio do it.

197
00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:42.804
And when the movie ran
over time and budget,

198
00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:45.348
he had to put up more collateral.

199
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:50.560
And so there was a lot of pressure
that, had the movie not been successful,

200
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.022
he could have ended up back at the start.

201
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.526
Echo-station five-seven,
we're on our way.

202
00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.404
George Lucas

203
00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:02.407
was a gift. He changed the
whole world of cinema.

204
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.534
He introduced all of these new ideas.

205
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.745
How do you explain that experience?

206
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.039
It was meant to be.

207
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.875
It changed everything.

208
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.392
Introducing Dorothy
r. Stratten, playboy's

209
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.394
playmate of the year, as
your favorite gal.

210
00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:33.645
Galaxina.

211
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.898
I couldn't tell you the plot of that
at all, it was Dorothy stratten, right?

212
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.651
I mean, that's all you need to know.

213
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.321
She was delightful to watch.

214
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.033
When I look at galaxina,
what I see is possibility,

215
00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.494
all kinds of possibilities.

216
00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.787
Galaxina is a parody movie.

217
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.206
Name's Mr. Spot.

218
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.501
Star Trek, star wars,
a little bit of alien.

219
00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.336
And all of the movies
that were made before it

220
00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:01.132
that were way, way better. At least two
tropes exist in the film galaxina.

221
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.384
These sort of representations of
the cantina from star wars,

222
00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.971
where all of these creatures
from all over the universe are.

223
00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:14.937
And the image of that spacecraft
coming across the screen,

224
00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:19.359
and going on forever, all kinds of nutty
things going on in that movie.

225
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:23.278
There's one relationship in that
movie that works and rings

226
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:27.824
as true and real. And it's the relationship
between galaxina and Stephen mok's

227
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.160
character, he plays Thor.

228
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.163
You're a machine, and
I'm a human being.

229
00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.583
Which is just another
kind of machine really.

230
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.417
They fall in love,

231
00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.699
but they can't really be in love
because she's an Android.

232
00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.130
But she figures out
how to correct something

233
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.133
so that she can have human feelings.

234
00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.177
I love you, sgt. Thor

235
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:55.353
those moments between those two actors,
are the realest moments in that movie.

236
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.314
In galaxina, we see the first idea

237
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.151
of sex bots in artificial
intelligent machines.

238
00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:06.030
How will they feel if they
develop self-awareness?

239
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.867
Where is the line?
Really pulls at our psychology.

240
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.745
I really think those provocative
stories are important for us.

241
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.039
What it all adds up to is something
that's not quite as good

242
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.793
as those individual pieces,
but those individual pieces

243
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.335
that are stuck in my head,

244
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.421
I will probably remember forever.

245
00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:26.717
I will remember that alien coming
out of Avery schreiber's mouth, forever.

246
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.555
Galaxina, sadly, the thing
that hangs over it

247
00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.308
more than anything is the
murder of Dorothy stratten.

248
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.727
It's hard to think of the movie
without remembering

249
00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.064
what happened to her.

250
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:45.194
I really appreciate galaxina, and not just
because of what happened to Dorothy,

251
00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.990
but because there was something
suggested in that movie,

252
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.407
that there could have been more there

253
00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:54.078
and there might have been
more in the future for her.

254
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.004
The final countdown
is about to begin.

255
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.547
The final countdown

256
00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:09.342
is about the USS nimitz,
an aircraft carrier in 1980

257
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:14.432
that gets sent back in time
to December 6th, 1941.

258
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.851
That was taken less
than an hour ago.

259
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.293
I don't understand, sir. These
are pre-world war ii pictures.

260
00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:22.314
Single handedly, with the one aircraft
carrier and all the modern technology

261
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.234
they have at their disposal,
could absolutely thwart

262
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.777
the attack on Pearl harbor.

263
00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.780
The United States of America
falls under attack.

264
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.408
Our job is to defend it.

265
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:35.119
The past, present or future.

266
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.079
Now, the question that the captain
and the crew have to face

267
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.542
is, do they do that because they are sworn
defenders of the United States,

268
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.168
and this is an enemy?

269
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.506
Or do they allow history to play
out as we know it did?

270
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.715
The classic time travel dilemma.

271
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:49.716
You jump back.

272
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:54.889
You've now caused this weird ripple
effect that you didn't expect.

273
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:59.227
This is going to create a
fracture in the timeline.

274
00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:02.730
We know where all of the mistakes are
going to be made for the next 40 years.

275
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.773
And you've got the power to correct them.

276
00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.317
You stay out of this.

277
00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:08.777
The final countdown is a great example

278
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:12.906
of that idea that, you know,
do you interfere or don't you?

279
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.618
If we could travel back in time,
would we want to change history?

280
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.161
How it would affect the future?

281
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:21.873
What if you go back in time and it kills
the bloodline of your grandparents,

282
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.415
then you never exist.

283
00:17:23.416 --> 00:17:26.002
I still have a gut instinct that
things only happened once,

284
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:29.048
and if they have happened, then there's
nothing we can do to change them.

285
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.675
Nor should we try.

286
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:34.844
There's all these paradoxical ideas
that exist in science fiction

287
00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:37.515
that have never been
really answered satisfactorily,

288
00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:42.853
because we don't have the science
yet to lean one way or another.

289
00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.189
It's an interesting enough
storyline that draws us in

290
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.360
and makes us think, you know, the
ramifications of action or inaction.

291
00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:53.697
This is the United States warship.
Or at least, it used to be!

292
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.700
Or will be, or what
the hell ever!

293
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.590
Who are you?

294
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.633
Flash Gordon, quarterback,
New York jets.

295
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:14.759
Flash Gordon was true

296
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.929
to the buster crabbe
serials and Alex Raymond

297
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.307
comic books.

298
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.853
I think if Nick roeg
had done flash Gordon

299
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.896
as the original plan was,
it would have been

300
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:30.692
a completely different movie than
the one that Mike Hodges did.

301
00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:33.570
I can hear dino now saying,
"no, it is a crazy, don't

302
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:37.657
do it like this, it is too much dream
like, we want with guns and shooting,

303
00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:40.369
and girls with big tits." You know?

304
00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.245
Dino de laurentiis.

305
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.332
He was like a svengali.

306
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.085
He had this big vision
that the movie mattered

307
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.129
above all else.

308
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.550
Michael Hodges came in
three weeks before filming.

309
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.552
Strange object imaged
in the imperial vortex.

310
00:18:58.846 --> 00:18:59.430
We ended up

311
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.515
basically improvising quite a bit.

312
00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:03.768
Yeah.

313
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.356
When you improvise,
sometimes you get gold.

314
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:11.942
Go, flash. Go!

315
00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.943
The sets were amazing,

316
00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:17.198
the costume was outrageously great.

317
00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.867
What was flash Gordon wearing

318
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:23.912
during the execution scene?

319
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:27.041
Hot pants, okay?
Green leather, hot pants.

320
00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:33.672
Tip of the hat to danilo donati,
who was the set and costume designer,

321
00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.300
he should have been nominated
at least for an academy award.

322
00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.343
Pathetic earthlings.

323
00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:40.346
Hurling your bodies
out into the void.

324
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.348
Max Von sydow,

325
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:47.144
his costume was so heavy
and difficult, he couldn't

326
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.230
sit down, they had to
lean him on a backboard.

327
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.650
Gordon's alive!

328
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.985
Brian blessed. They broke the mold

329
00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.904
when he came to this planet.

330
00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:59.907
To the death!

331
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.826
In the scene

332
00:20:01.827 --> 00:20:04.620
with the moving disc
with Sam and Timothy Dalton,

333
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.457
Brian blessed is just making
one crack after another.

334
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:09.999
I was laughing so hard.

335
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.080
Why are prisoners tortured?

336
00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.670
And the scene where I'm on the table
and he pinches

337
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:16.966
my bottom was not in the script,
it was a Brian blessed special.

338
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.968
I have my suspicions.

339
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.012
One of the amazing things
about flash Gordon,

340
00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:25.599
it was the sweetness of it, the innocence.

341
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:26.642
Oh, it's so crazy!

342
00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:30.813
And that sweetness allows for the room
to have all these double entendres.

343
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:35.359
Some adult content,
subtle and not-so-subtle.

344
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.698
Ming has his magic ring that
causes me to have a lot of pleasure.

345
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.034
But it works because I'm this
innocent who just doesn't quite know

346
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.954
what's going on.

347
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.497
Did you ever see such repsonse?

348
00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.500
No, truly. She even
rivals your daughter.

349
00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.129
Look at ornella, that seduction scene

350
00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.882
where she's sitting on my lap,
I kept telling the director,

351
00:20:58.007 --> 00:20:59.674
I'm not really getting this.

352
00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.802
I need another take, okay?

353
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:03.846
Oh my god, this girl's
really turning me on.

354
00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:06.348
I didn't quite get that.
Think it again.

355
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.682
Oh, yeah,

356
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.770
that took it to a whole nother level.

357
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:14.607
I was told in the beginning
dino did not want queen.

358
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.361
He was quoted as saying,
“no, that's a not for my movie."

359
00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:22.490
Queen not only complimented flash Gordon,

360
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:24.533
it brought tremendous value.

361
00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.583
It was rock and roll, it was
festive, it was lyrical,

362
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:34.834
and that's what the movie is.

363
00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:37.755
This is not a dark movie,
it's a cartoon strip,

364
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:40.424
so it was supposed to
be energetic and fun.

365
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.384
It is what it is.

366
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:47.890
Just sit back and enjoy being transported.

367
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.603
If you're faced with
any storm in your life,

368
00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.605
you just call upon flash Gordon.

369
00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:56.732
It's timeless.

370
00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:58.776
Yeah!

371
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:10.537
If you were a kid coming
of age in the 1980s,

372
00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:13.415
you were worried
that nuclear war would start.

373
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.377
We were at the height
of the cold war in the 1980s.

374
00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:21.841
The height of an understanding
of what nuclear technology could do

375
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.218
and its potential for devastation.

376
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:32.267
I remember as a child, we lived
near an air force base.

377
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:35.144
Four bells meant get under the desk.

378
00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:37.147
- Duck!
- Duck and cover.

379
00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:38.816
Duck and cover.
Duck and cover yourselves.

380
00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.483
Duck and cover.

381
00:22:40.484 --> 00:22:44.530
And they're telling you that's going
to save you from a new killer attack.

382
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:47.449
Duck and cover. Attaboy, Tony.

383
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:49.368
That flash means: Act fast.

384
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.537
This was a given, this was going to happen.

385
00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:56.083
So, of course, we all had
nightmares, I had very vivid ones.

386
00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:01.129
Superpowers were going head to
head every other week in the news,

387
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.008
and we entered the '80s
with enormous apprehension.

388
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:09.513
If the Soviet union is attacked, we will
answer with all our nuclear might.

389
00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:13.057
What science fiction films
did at that time,

390
00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:15.603
I think was gave us
an outlet, a catharsis,

391
00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:20.190
by extrapolating the
potential for devastation.

392
00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:24.569
By the time you had Reagan in
the us, and Thatcher in the UK,

393
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.490
and you had sort of the latter
era Soviet leadership,

394
00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:34.580
there was enormous western exceptionalism
that invaded all of the art.

395
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:37.416
So it wasn't surprising that

396
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:42.754
the audiences escaped as a means
of processing fears and ideas

397
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:46.800
about the geopolitical situation,
but also the political situation at home,

398
00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.135
which wasn't great either.

399
00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:52.263
I was in the air force
for most of the 19803.

400
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:56.644
I was stationed in a nuclear silo
in north Dakota for a portion of time.

401
00:23:56.977 --> 00:23:58.770
These fears were palpable.

402
00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:02.399
So when we went to see movies like
wargames, firefox,

403
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:06.236
these films tried to be
as realistic, speculative

404
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.530
but as realistic as possible.

405
00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:13.535
I'm speaking to the individual who has
stolen the property of the ussr.

406
00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:15.579
We're getting the royal treatment.

407
00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:16.913
So whether you're talking about a movie

408
00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:21.501
like Superman iv, a bond movie or a movie
like weird science where a nuclear missile

409
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:25.047
comes up through the floor in the bedroom,
the cold war is right there in the film.

410
00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:30.134
When we saw these movies,
we didn't have to be so scared

411
00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.179
we could let somebody else
handle the problem.

412
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:37.184
Wolverines!

413
00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:39.687
And something really drove James Cameron

414
00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:44.149
as a filmmaker, nuclear war,
and that whole idea is in all his films.

415
00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:48.153
It's a background to skynet
and the Terminator.

416
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.322
It's there in aliens.

417
00:24:50.364 --> 00:24:53.826
I say we take off and nuke
the entire site from orbit.

418
00:24:57.287 --> 00:25:00.082
And it's a motif in Cameron films,
the mushroom clouds.

419
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:04.837
And by Terminator 2, you get
that shocking dream sequence.

420
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.088
And it really was in your
face by that point.

421
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:09.633
It wasn't a metaphor anymore.
It really was James Cameron going,

422
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.553
"this is what it's going
to be like, people."

423
00:25:16.974 --> 00:25:20.269
Do you know exactly what your
family would do if an attack came?

424
00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:21.353
On the other side of it,

425
00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:25.857
you got parables like threads,
which was made in britain

426
00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:29.445
about what happens if a
nuclear attack actually went off.

427
00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.364
The real threat

428
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:37.453
of nuclear armageddon
was never very far away,

429
00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:40.496
so when the day after comes out, it took

430
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:44.877
what was an existential fear for
me and it gave it visuals.

431
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.755
It won't be pretty, it won't be fast,

432
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:52.384
I mean, the lucky ones,
will die out, right?

433
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:57.056
Nothing on network television
like this had ever been shown.

434
00:25:57.973 --> 00:26:00.309
If you have a nuclear war,

435
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:03.562
this is what it's going
to be like on a good day.

436
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.445
The day after was a huge
television phenomenon.

437
00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:15.616
It showed that you could
do the darker story.

438
00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:18.743
It was painful to watch
because the radiation

439
00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:21.622
was definitely going to get to
us and kill us at some point.

440
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:26.502
The day after is the most watched
movie made for television ever.

441
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:31.590
100 million people watched it
in one night, so I was quite stunned.

442
00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:34.885
But there was one person's mind
who was changed overnight,

443
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:38.138
and that happened to be the president
of the United States, Ronald Reagan,

444
00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:40.974
who had come to power believing

445
00:26:41.183 --> 00:26:44.478
that there was such a thing
as a winnable nuclear war.

446
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:48.023
I spent the '80s in Thatcher's London.

447
00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:51.527
I was very interested in
getting Reagan out of office.

448
00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:55.614
My fear of what these

449
00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:59.368
politicians can do, the people
that I cannot control.

450
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:05.124
I focus my energies on what I can do
in my own little corner of the world.

451
00:27:07.918 --> 00:27:09.001
We've been living

452
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:11.880
with the cold war since world war ii,

453
00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:17.677
generations have lived under that threat,
and I don't think one generation

454
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:20.305
is any more immune to
that threat than another.

455
00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:24.601
Today, you know, we're worried
about the very slow end of the world

456
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:28.438
from, you know, environmental
things or terrorist acts.

457
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:32.401
I think ever since we created the
bomb, the world has been different.

458
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:34.318
People were just channeling

459
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.156
their beliefs, their fears or nightmare
scenarios into these stories.

460
00:27:38.157 --> 00:27:40.408
And now we're at an age
where in the modern day,

461
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:43.619
it's all about lack of privacy
and how the Internet and the machines

462
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.413
are going to take over.

463
00:27:44.414 --> 00:27:46.080
And we're going to become
dehumanized to the point

464
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.957
where we're just slaves to the machines.

465
00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:50.794
It's an interesting cycle
to have walked through.

466
00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:05.850
In the '803, there were several

467
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:09.354
shrinking movies, which I guess
somehow that became funny.

468
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.026
Honey, I shrunk the kids, the incredible
shrinking woman and innerspace.

469
00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:15.611
And they were all good.

470
00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:17.653
Now, how about a big
hand with a little lady?

471
00:28:17.654 --> 00:28:19.656
The incredible shrinking woman.

472
00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:25.286
To take on the book

473
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.747
incredible shrinking man.

474
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:30.959
The top news story of the day continues
to be the incredible shrinking woman.

475
00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:34.087
I'm sure there must be
some logical explanation.

476
00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:36.340
The satire on advertising.

477
00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:39.968
Galaxy blue. Galaxy blue.

478
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:41.303
She's a tiny housewife,

479
00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:43.764
and she has to deal with
all these products coming at her.

480
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:45.474
The glue, the solvent,
your bubble bath.

481
00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:47.517
Talcum powder, shampoo...

482
00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:50.186
He was making fun of these products

483
00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:53.190
that are fed to them like
this is going to make your life better.

484
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:55.234
It's called

485
00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:57.819
tre natural.

486
00:28:58.195 --> 00:28:59.862
And what started to happen

487
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.030
with the women's movement
is they were going,

488
00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:03.908
I don't want to make my life
at home better that much.

489
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:04.951
I want to be out of here.

490
00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:08.663
Making dinner or doing
the laundry is not all

491
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:10.415
I want to do.

492
00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:12.417
Judith, I don't think this
is such a good idea.

493
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:16.629
Lily tomlin, she's perfect
because she's a comedian

494
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.260
and she can embody the craziness
of that. She has this insane range.

495
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.262
And you better lay off
of buttons, fester.

496
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.638
I'm in it for like a very
short amount of time.

497
00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:28.892
I'm advertising soap,
but they cut it.

498
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.645
When Lily hit in the Barbie
dream house, it's so great

499
00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:37.943
because that's an iconic thing from girls
childhood to be the size of your dolls.

500
00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:40.736
It's all about the insignificance.

501
00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.739
Off the frutniture!

502
00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:47.077
And what are you grinning
at, you big creep?

503
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:48.036
The dolls,

504
00:29:48.037 --> 00:29:50.956
if they were bigger than you, life size,

505
00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:53.542
they would be terrifying.

506
00:29:58.171 --> 00:29:59.171
Lily gets smaller

507
00:29:59.172 --> 00:30:02.509
and smaller, and then falls
into the garbage disposal,

508
00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:06.304
which is, first of all, everyone's
nightmare, like when you drop something

509
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:08.139
to the garbage disposal
and you have to reach in,

510
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.765
and take it out.

511
00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.934
There's like a built in terror.

512
00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:14.395
That's the big, actual

513
00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:17.524
visual point that she's
not a factor anymore.

514
00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:22.154
She's just doing herjob and she's
becoming smaller and smaller as a person.

515
00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:23.405
I'm going to lose my mind!

516
00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:26.783
And it's the war that women
then started to feel like

517
00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:29.785
this isn't my life,
I don't want this to be my life.

518
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:32.789
I'm sick of products!
I'm sick of advertising!

519
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:35.041
You're talking about my work!

520
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:37.127
See, I love things that
have themes like that.

521
00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.171
More champagne?

522
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:43.300
Vance, look what you did!

523
00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:55.479
Outland. The ultimate
enemy is still man.

524
00:30:57.189 --> 00:31:00.108
An underrated classic
from early '803 science fiction.

525
00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:04.236
Sean Connery plays a federal marshal
who was sent to this backwater

526
00:31:04.237 --> 00:31:07.157
mining colony on a moon of Jupiter.

527
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:11.911
He discovers a drug operation
where the drugs that are being used

528
00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:15.414
by the miners and sold to the miners
to make them boost their productivity

529
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:17.459
is actually killing them.

530
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:21.004
Get it off!

531
00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:26.967
I was desperate to make a western.

532
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:30.597
Certainly after people like George Lucas
figured out, wait a second,

533
00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:35.267
the western is not dead, it's alive,
it's in outer space, so I modeled it

534
00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:40.732
after dodge city, the frontier aspect
of it, the harshness and the danger

535
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:45.028
and the greed, and the fact that
if you just stepped outside, you died.

536
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:51.201
That's a completely conceivable future
where we actually go out and we actually

537
00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:55.247
mine asteroids and mine planets
and stuff. And it's a corporate entity.

538
00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:58.166
We're on our way to becoming the
leading con amalgamate operation.

539
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:01.711
And everyone in this room has
received the bonus checks to prove it.

540
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:05.172
It's a social commentary
about how to control economies

541
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:07.634
and how to control corporate people.

542
00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:09.677
We are all professionals.

543
00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:11.555
I'm sure we are.

544
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.014
I first wrote it when I was at universal.

545
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:16.434
I remember ned tanen read
the script and said,

546
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:19.019
"I like it, we'll make it if
Eastwood will do it."

547
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.023
And I said, "well, you'll make
the phone book if Eastwood will do it."

548
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.441
Sean Connery will...

549
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:25.734
He'll bring Connery to whatever he plays.

550
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:28.320
Zero ego about anything to do

551
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:31.741
with him and total ego
about how to make the movie good.

552
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:36.037
So every discussion you had with him
was how to make the script better.

553
00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:38.164
How to make the movie better.

554
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:39.249
He was a remarkable guy.

555
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:41.375
There's a whole machine that works,

556
00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:44.504
because everybody does
what they're supposed to.

557
00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:46.089
I did write one

558
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:49.634
line where I said,
I can't wait for him to say it.

559
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.219
And it's at the end of a very big chase.

560
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.054
He's got a guy cornered in the kitchen

561
00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:56.516
and then he fires his gun
all around the guy.

562
00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.311
Think it over.

563
00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:00.562
Think it over.

564
00:33:00.604 --> 00:33:02.606
It's like butter with him.

565
00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.649
When they dig more oil,
the company's happy.

566
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:06.818
When the company's happy, I'm happy.

567
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.652
I first knew

568
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:09.738
Peter boyle from seeing
a movie called Joe.

569
00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:14.825
So the first film that I ever
wrote, I got to know Peter

570
00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:18.913
and thought he was terrific. And I
needed somebody with some grit.

571
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:20.933
If you're looking for money,
you're smarter than you look.

572
00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:23.752
If you're not, you're
a lot dumber.

573
00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:26.004
Frances sternhagen.

574
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:27.631
Hello.

575
00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.633
It's the drug.

576
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.884
You just won a prize.

577
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.760
The part originally was written for a man.

578
00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:35.679
I said, I want to cast a woman
and make no change

579
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.806
in the script.

580
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:39.726
Almost everybody here doesn't
have both oars in the water,

581
00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:41.061
as far as I'm concerned.

582
00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:42.997
Everything she said
was a little different,

583
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.190
everything she said was her way.

584
00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:48.527
There hasn't been so much excitement in
this heap for some time.

585
00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.152
When it came to outland,

586
00:33:50.153 --> 00:33:53.156
the idea of a mining conglomerate
seemed feasible to me.

587
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.992
I wanted you to see the kind
of hostility of the environment

588
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:58.912
and who are the people
who would be doing it.

589
00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:02.791
And why would they be doing it.

590
00:34:06.545 --> 00:34:09.213
I never won an Oscar, except one
of the things that I wanted

591
00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:13.677
more than anything else was to do a film
that would be parodied in mad magazine.

592
00:34:13.927 --> 00:34:16.012
And they did outland in mad magazine.

593
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:19.266
I was thrilled, to me the
highest compliment I could be paid.

594
00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:28.454
You and I know that when anybody says
which it's the best Superman,

595
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:29.942
they say ii.

596
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:32.445
You haven't seen the best part.

597
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:36.866
Superman ii. The adventure continues.

598
00:34:37.324 --> 00:34:42.539
Superman ii remains about truth,
justice and the American way.

599
00:34:43.123 --> 00:34:45.373
There is no doubt about that.

600
00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:48.377
It is also about the villains coming back
and maybe getting Superman,

601
00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:50.170
and that's the best part.

602
00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.215
Superman!

603
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:57.304
There is no question about the
fact that Christopher reeve

604
00:34:57.637 --> 00:35:03.018
embodied Superman,
I just think he was extraordinary.

605
00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:06.646
I believe this is your floor.

606
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.355
He was a little dorky.

607
00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:10.567
He was more like Clark Kent than Superman.

608
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.199
Terence stamp remains
the sexiest man on earth.

609
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:21.036
Kneel before Zod.

610
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:22.995
Jack looked like Jack,

611
00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:25.832
all the time, I hasten to add.

612
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.752
We moved a certain way

613
00:35:29.085 --> 00:35:31.338
and we moved with a fluidity.

614
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:35.299
Three villains flying along,
they'd got the tracks

615
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.261
up in the roof like
railway tracks up there.

616
00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:41.473
Somebody hadn't quite worked out
that when you go round a corner,

617
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.100
the momentum swings you out.

618
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.018
So the three of us start off very well,

619
00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:49.439
then we go round a corner and then we all
get tangled up together and there we hang.

620
00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:53.233
Stepping on the moon,

621
00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:55.737
it was the most extraordinary set.

622
00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:57.696
What kind of a creature are you?

623
00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.699
Just a man.

624
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:01.242
A man?

625
00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:04.496
Do you know that scene where
I kick the astronaut in the groin?

626
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.372
When I went to Japan to promote the film,

627
00:36:06.373 --> 00:36:08.583
they cut that scene
because it was too violent.

628
00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:11.961
A woman kicking a man like that
just doesn't do, does it?

629
00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:16.883
Margot kidder

630
00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:20.844
absolutely made contact
when she had to clip me

631
00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:23.890
because we tried it a few times
and it just didn't look too real.

632
00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:25.934
You're a real pain in the neck!

633
00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:29.187
She got me so much that
I went over the edge.

634
00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:31.605
It's like, “got the shot,

635
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:34.108
moving on, thank you very much."

636
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:37.778
We weren't killed off,
we just disappeared, if you like.

637
00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:39.405
To be able to come back.

638
00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:42.742
There was definitely
speculation about that.

639
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:48.163
Superman I and ii, we shot
them back to back.

640
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:51.584
With Richard donner,
who we all adored.

641
00:36:51.918 --> 00:36:56.673
We took a break because at a certain point
we'd shot so much of Superman ll,

642
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.924
they needed to concentrate
on Superman I.

643
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.468
Of course they did.

644
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:04.556
I literally got back on the set
and it was Richard Lester.

645
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.058
To reshoot the same sequence

646
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:12.313
with two incredibly different directors
was the best experience of my life.

647
00:37:19.529 --> 00:37:21.405
Consequently, when

648
00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:24.951
it came to selling
Superman ii, it was me.

649
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.953
Warner brothers put me through
my paces to see if I could

650
00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:30.957
talk about the film
without spilling the beans.

651
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.835
The fact that they changed directors

652
00:37:34.294 --> 00:37:38.173
was just something we never talked
about in the marketing of the film.

653
00:37:38.214 --> 00:37:42.468
That was a more naive period
where people weren't

654
00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:46.765
so into all the nuances of filmmaking.

655
00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:50.184
At the beginning, it was marvelous
and glorious, and we all loved each other.

656
00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:53.145
By the end, it was just
we'd all had enough, I think.

657
00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:56.399
I often think of the enormity

658
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:59.360
of certainly the impact of Superman.

659
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:03.239
Everybody has seen Superman.
Around the world,

660
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.992
whether it be on television,
whatever it is, it's a love fest.

661
00:38:17.587 --> 00:38:20.756
Before we lived in a dystopian reality,

662
00:38:20.757 --> 00:38:24.969
I really enjoyed
dystopian science fiction.

663
00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:27.972
John carpenter's escape
from New York.

664
00:38:28.014 --> 00:38:32.018
The greatest escape of them all
is about to blow the future apart.

665
00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:33.728
Escape from New York

666
00:38:33.729 --> 00:38:38.650
actually started as John carpenter's
first screenplay out of film school.

667
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:42.402
After he had done a few, studio
really wanted to work with him

668
00:38:42.403 --> 00:38:44.196
and said, basically, what do you got?

669
00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:47.450
And he went to the closet,
brought out the script.

670
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:49.660
They loved the idea.

671
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.869
He called me.

672
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.747
He said, "I really need another mind

673
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:57.084
here to help me get through this
and make sense of it."

674
00:38:57.085 --> 00:38:59.420
So I think it was a
valuable collaboration.

675
00:38:59.462 --> 00:39:03.424
You go in, find the president,
bring him out in 24 hours,

676
00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:05.051
and you're a free man.

677
00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:06.093
24 hours, huh?

678
00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:09.764
Escape from New York was the
biggest movie I'd made up to that time.

679
00:39:10.223 --> 00:39:12.891
It was basically the same crew
and some of the same cast

680
00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:15.019
I'd worked with before,
so it was fun to do.

681
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:19.232
It was hard work trying
to keep everything light

682
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:21.568
if we can.

683
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:25.070
It was like a huge family

684
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:30.784
working with actors that he loves
both personally and professionally.

685
00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:35.456
He knows that he can get the performance
out of them that he wants.

686
00:39:39.252 --> 00:39:41.044
And they have much more fun working

687
00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:44.257
if you're, you know, everything
is calm, and here we go.

688
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:48.052
St. Louis, which was the
beginning of the shoot.

689
00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:52.432
They shot much of the exterior material.
St. Louis at the time

690
00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:56.185
looked like post-apocalyptical,
you know, United States.

691
00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:59.147
You didn't have to do a
lot of window dressing.

692
00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:03.359
Nothing was done in New York
other than being on Liberty island.

693
00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:07.947
Kurt was always known
and grew up as a Disney kid,

694
00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:11.659
but John can see into
what the potential is in people.

695
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:15.162
I recognized Kurt early on
when we did Elvis.

696
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:16.955
This guy's got it.

697
00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.666
He really has it.

698
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:22.544
Just knowing Kurt, you know

699
00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:26.883
he has the potential for doing something
that's a little darker and physical.

700
00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:36.184
Love the character of Maggie.

701
00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:39.853
Balls out chick, you know,

702
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:42.023
and I was used to playing
that kind of role.

703
00:40:42.065 --> 00:40:45.526
You're plissken?
I heard you were dead.

704
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:47.903
I think her entire moral character

705
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:51.991
is exhibited in the last scene,
where she reaches

706
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.872
out her hand to snake for the gun
and she fires at the Duke.

707
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.794
Thatjust said everything
to me about her.

708
00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.964
Escape from New York

709
00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:09.384
really, its philosophical bent was
it was a nihilist film.

710
00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:13.178
It had a nihilist character
it had a nihilist ending,

711
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:16.057
but it was also done in a way
that was tongue in cheek.

712
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:20.269
We're going to go far in this
direction and have fun with it.

713
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.022
Don't kill yourself
after you see this film.

714
00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:25.024
You're going to kill
me now, snake?

715
00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:27.986
I'm too tired.

716
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:30.612
Maybe later.

717
00:41:30.613 --> 00:41:34.408
If you want to know who would win
a fight between snake plissken,

718
00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:38.454
Jack Burton or rj macready, snake
plissken would win the fight

719
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:39.414
hands down.

720
00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:41.457
He's a bad ass, that's why.

721
00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:50.174
A universe of magic.

722
00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:52.218
Heavy metal.

723
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.469
Heavy metal,

724
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.598
the movie, was a very interesting
experience for young, 14 year old me.

725
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.560
Yeah, my worldview shifted
after watching that film.

726
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:07.024
I was a fan of the magazine,

727
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.861
a fan of the art,
fan of the storytelling.

728
00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:14.032
It played into my interests
in a very natural way.

729
00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.410
I said, "it would be great
as an animated film."

730
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:19.871
My powers continue.

731
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.046
It showed you the possibility of animation
and sci fi and more sophisticated ideas.

732
00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:32.175
Beautiful, but it's also really subversive

733
00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:33.342
and countercultural.

734
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:37.387
I told you, I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers or something.

735
00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:39.390
Goddamn legal aliens.

736
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:42.018
The source material,
the heavy metal stories

737
00:42:42.101 --> 00:42:45.521
really in themselves
had a kind of level of explicitness

738
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.607
that was freeing,
I think, for the artists.

739
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:50.942
I saw that as something that was quite fun

740
00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:52.403
and delicious.

741
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:55.823
I'm afraid that I'll come home one
day and find you screwing the toaster.

742
00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.368
You'll just have to trust me.

743
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:03.498
Gerald potterton was a really fine
animation director in Canada.

744
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:06.292
I sort of enlisted him as kind of a

745
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.586
central filmmaking group
to tell this story.

746
00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.007
Len blum and Dan goldberg

747
00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:16.385
who I had worked
with on meatballs,

748
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:21.307
they came up with that sort of magical
sort of deadly green ball from outer space

749
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.976
as a way of sort of linking
the stories together.

750
00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:27.563
Someone always finds me.

751
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:35.446
My favorite sequence in heavy
metal is den.

752
00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:38.573
Can I slit his throat,
your majesty?

753
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:40.576
Yes.

754
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:42.661
I liked the heavy metal magazine.

755
00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:45.873
It's an actually an adept
recreation of that vibe.

756
00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:47.415
And if I refuse?

757
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:51.212
If you refuse, you die.
She dies. Everybody dies.

758
00:43:51.254 --> 00:43:53.256
Sounded reasonable to me.

759
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:56.383
The 8-1? Bomber that crashes on
the island with the zombies,

760
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.928
that's probably my favorite individual
vignette from the film.

761
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.972
Nose dive!

762
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.973
The two space pilots

763
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:05.476
that get high on the space,
cocaine is also a funny one.

764
00:44:12.358 --> 00:44:13.317
Taarna,

765
00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:17.488
as a huge moebius fan, I wanted to
sort of give him all due respect.

766
00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.619
Maybe she wants to fight.

767
00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:29.250
I want her dead!!!

768
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.376
What I remember

769
00:44:30.377 --> 00:44:32.545
about heavy metal
is the music in that film.

770
00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:36.591
All of the bands
that have a song in that film,

771
00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:40.760
I have cranked that soundtrack
so many times over the years.

772
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:42.513
I wore out so many cassette tapes.

773
00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:48.101
Yeah, the future is now pretty
well illustrated by musk

774
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:52.023
sticking a Tesla into space, like
the opening of the heavy metal movie.

775
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:57.402
I wish we could have finished it
in a slightly more complete way, I mean,

776
00:44:57.403 --> 00:45:01.490
we were working under the gun in terms
of timetable, in terms of budget,

777
00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:06.037
but I'm still quite taken
by how still effective it was.

778
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.834
I think we were just
really ahead of the curve

779
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.545
in all sorts of ways.

780
00:45:14.587 --> 00:45:16.588
Okay, sucker. Hand over your cash!

781
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:18.591
Now!

782
00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:29.352
One of the ways

783
00:45:29.353 --> 00:45:32.104
you can say whether a film
has succeeded or failed

784
00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:36.149
is can you imagine
a life for the characters

785
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.819
and the movie itself
beyond the frame you've seen.

786
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.283
World building became enormously
important during '803 science fiction.

787
00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:48.663
So you have concept design
and production design.

788
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:53.334
You have to go and build interiors,
build these kind of planets

789
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:58.047
physically on sets, and
creating locations that work.

790
00:45:58.547 --> 00:46:01.217
You have concept designed around

791
00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:06.555
props and imagined future technology.

792
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:12.812
Present day idea is extrapolated, and this
thing goes on into, of course, costume,

793
00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:16.440
how do spaceships
move and travel in the future.

794
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.484
It's the natural evolution

795
00:46:19.485 --> 00:46:22.821
of a storyteller to think beyond
the things that inspire them,

796
00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:27.451
imagining the possibilities
of taking it to the next step.

797
00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:30.495
For directors like Spielberg

798
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:35.084
and Cameron and Ridley Scott,
this became almost a challenge

799
00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:39.922
to create an accurate picture
of the future in different ways.

800
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:43.426
Make you know, a straightfonnard
film extraordinary.

801
00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.428
Something's there.

802
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:49.681
I love the worlds that existed
in all of these science fiction movies,

803
00:46:49.682 --> 00:46:53.102
and I wanted to explore
them as fully as I could.

804
00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:58.064
Very satisfying to work
on pictures like that

805
00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:02.153
where you bring a whole universe
to life for a film audience.

806
00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.487
Usually when I'm hired,

807
00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:06.490
nobody else is hired
except for the director,

808
00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:11.329
and we start discussing the script and I
hire illustrators and storyboard artists.

809
00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.998
We start to develop
a look for the picture,

810
00:47:14.206 --> 00:47:17.418
which is very important
because he can see his vision now

811
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:21.171
of what this picture is and
the studio, they start to see,

812
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:23.966
"wow, this is where our 100 million
dollars is going to go.

813
00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:26.344
We're going to have
that". And they get excited.

814
00:47:29.221 --> 00:47:32.265
Something that is, of course,
hugely important in science fiction

815
00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:35.268
because it doesn't exist anywhere
around us, are the visual

816
00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:38.480
designers, the guys that decide,
what the buildings, what the landscape

817
00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:41.566
should look like, the objects,
the spaceships, the creatures.

818
00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:43.069
It's all choices.

819
00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:49.241
Syd mead, Ron Cobb, Ralph mcquarrie,
just the visionaries of science fiction,

820
00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:52.870
and they have dreamt up
so many iconic things.

821
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:58.625
They're quite instrumental
in bringing life to a lot of

822
00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:01.545
what goes on on the screen.

823
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.716
In science fiction, a lot of the things

824
00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:09.803
that you're going to see
are visual effects, those things don't

825
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:14.225
exist in reality, you know,
warp drives and spinners.

826
00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:18.104
So we have to invent
sounds that don't exist in reality.

827
00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:25.403
My job is to ensure that you hear
everything that you do see.

828
00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.405
Did you see that?!

829
00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:29.989
It's really

830
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:33.077
the sound underneath it
coming up out of the floor

831
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:37.373
and shaking you to your core.

832
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:41.001
That's all encompassed in this term
I call universe building.

833
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.755
I need to create the Sonic universe
that we take for granted,

834
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:48.216
such that when you go to the cinema,
you feel as though you're

835
00:48:48.217 --> 00:48:53.264
in a believable environment,
even if it's in an unbelievable context.

836
00:48:57.143 --> 00:48:59.894
The genius of star wars,
is it just imbued character

837
00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:04.107
into everything, into its planets,
into cities, into its characters,

838
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:08.654
obviously, nothing star wars touched
didn't involve character and feel.

839
00:49:09.113 --> 00:49:12.741
So the falcon, which is the heart
of all great movie spaceships,

840
00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:15.619
became an extension of Han Solo.

841
00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:19.039
She may not look like much,
but she's go it where it counts, kid.

842
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:21.083
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

843
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.418
And then you have the complete opposite

844
00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:26.547
end with films like mad Max

845
00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:30.885
and their version
of spacecraft is a vehicle.

846
00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:36.807
Weapons.

847
00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:41.437
The classic ones in star wars
are the blaster versus the lightsaber,

848
00:49:41.687 --> 00:49:44.647
the lightsaber represents
the old order of kind of grace

849
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.773
from the past.

850
00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:47.776
An elegant weapon

851
00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.820
for a more civilized age.

852
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:52.197
Then you have James Cameron,

853
00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:56.076
you know, he's about the
physicality of armament.

854
00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.955
And you go to something like Star Trek.

855
00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:05.753
It's a cleaner universe,
and all the uniforms are kind of coded

856
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.964
by rank, so it's much more about

857
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.884
a military organization.

858
00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:18.807
Costumes, of course, are a great
ingredient of science fiction.

859
00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:22.978
I mean, the opportunity they give
to costume designers to imagine

860
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:27.107
the impossible, a wonderful
opportunity to be creative.

861
00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:30.736
None of the work that any of
us do is the end result.

862
00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:31.445
None of it.

863
00:50:31.446 --> 00:50:34.073
It all is part of a process

864
00:50:34.448 --> 00:50:37.451
and we're all in this together.

865
00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.163
These brilliant filmmakers
give us amazing, astonishing work,

866
00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:44.458
but our brains will build much more
than they can possibly do,

867
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.019
and that's what they should be doing.

868
00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:49.755
They're kind of lighting a match to a
touch paper and going, okay, off you go.

869
00:50:49.964 --> 00:50:53.007
You know, dream up the
other elements of this world.

870
00:50:53.008 --> 00:50:55.803
Imagine for yourselves
what these planets are like.

871
00:50:58.097 --> 00:51:00.181
They are the things that stay with you.

872
00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:03.644
What's going on on
the other side of the door?

873
00:51:10.317 --> 00:51:11.901
If you're a movie geek
and you don't understand

874
00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:15.531
the significance of 1982, you have
to turn in your movie nerd card.

875
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.586
The post-apocalyptic genre

876
00:51:29.587 --> 00:51:31.922
is pretty much defined by
the mad Max movies.

877
00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.426
The road warrior.

878
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:41.599
A kind of harsher, cooler
vision of science fiction,

879
00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:44.767
it's like a western.
Barren world where petrol

880
00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.687
is the only commodity.

881
00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:49.731
Just walk away.
Give me your pump,

882
00:51:49.732 --> 00:51:53.527
the oil, the gasoline,
and the whole compound.

883
00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:55.821
They did what they needed
to do to survive.

884
00:51:59.325 --> 00:51:59.992
They were working

885
00:51:59.993 --> 00:52:03.078
in a genre of picture called
the exploitation picture.

886
00:52:03.329 --> 00:52:05.246
That's how they got funded.

887
00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:08.500
Action, adventure,
exploding cars, violence,

888
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:13.047
mayhem and the low budget seemed
to be a challenge rather than an obstacle.

889
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:18.594
I am really attracted to that sort
of bootstrapping kind of storytelling.

890
00:52:18.636 --> 00:52:20.638
Good dog. Nice doggy.

891
00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:26.602
George Miller is an amazing director.

892
00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:31.732
George had built a universe,
this dystopian future

893
00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:34.484
that mad Max lived within.

894
00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:36.487
You want to get out of here?

895
00:52:36.528 --> 00:52:38.530
You talk to me.

896
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:41.325
George had flashed it all out.

897
00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:49.749
It's not just a matter of going out
and shooting a lot of cars being flipped

898
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:53.127
and people dressed up strangely
and mohawk bikers running

899
00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:55.047
round and screaming.

900
00:52:56.924 --> 00:52:57.924
There was a definite

901
00:52:57.925 --> 00:53:00.511
heart to everything that George
did in that movie.

902
00:53:01.261 --> 00:53:04.390
George Miller gave me all
the tools that I needed

903
00:53:04.765 --> 00:53:07.809
to be wez, and I'm
nothing like that character.

904
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:11.855
I mean, there's no way in god's
earth that I can ever be wez.

905
00:53:12.147 --> 00:53:15.900
You! You can run
but you can't hide!

906
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:17.068
They always used to say to me,

907
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:19.822
“just do it at 150%, we can
bring it down to 100."

908
00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:28.706
What he wanted was this punk
rock version of science fiction.

909
00:53:29.081 --> 00:53:31.625
It's unthinkable that a
mad Max film would do what

910
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.421
a fast and furious film does
and just throw in cgi.

911
00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:38.632
Now they worry about us knowing
the stunts we've done for real

912
00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:42.094
and that kind of sense of
violence that came with that.

913
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.348
We didn't use any

914
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:50.352
special effects of that one
that was in camera.

915
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:58.193
Safety was a Paramount concern.

916
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.195
The vehicle I'm climbing onto,
which has 16 wheels,

917
00:54:01.196 --> 00:54:03.741
is going to run over me if I slip.

918
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.910
One of the stunt guys that was
on it would just grab me.

919
00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:11.373
For a decade, that was
all about the future

920
00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:14.251
and tech and computers and sci fi.

921
00:54:14.835 --> 00:54:16.627
It's stripped all of that away.

922
00:54:16.628 --> 00:54:17.504
It's very prescient if you look at where
we're going with the climate crisis.

923
00:54:17.505 --> 00:54:21.424
If you look at where we're going
with the climate crisis and how tribalism

924
00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:23.802
is sort of already taking root
and people are picking sides.

925
00:54:23.844 --> 00:54:25.804
You have defied me!

926
00:54:25.846 --> 00:54:27.848
You will know the vengeance of
the lord humungus!

927
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.521
Road warrior was a warning
of where we were headed.

928
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.816
They weren't just doing a film,
they were out there

929
00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:41.987
showing people the dysfunction
that we were headed for.

930
00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:46.867
That we're there.

931
00:54:57.836 --> 00:54:59.962
When star wars came out,

932
00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:03.090
my dad was saying, "I think we're going
to get a call from Paramount

933
00:55:03.091 --> 00:55:04.425
and they're going to want us back.

934
00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:05.969
Wait and see."

935
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:15.270
To dad, the motion picture was a
disappointing film on a number of levels.

936
00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:18.356
Star Trek is not as visionary as 2001.

937
00:55:18.357 --> 00:55:19.982
It's not as exuberant as star wars.

938
00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:24.445
Most of the industry thought that
after the poor reception of the first star

939
00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:28.951
trek film, that was going to be pretty
much the end of the franchise.

940
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:35.249
It wasn't until the Nick meyer showed
up, that things got back on track.

941
00:55:35.582 --> 00:55:38.168
Star Trek ll

942
00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:41.505
the wrath of Khan

943
00:55:41.547 --> 00:55:44.091
a lot of my choices

944
00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:48.929
were kind of in reaction to
Star Trek the motion picture,

945
00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:52.975
I wanted things to be more
confined, more submarine like.

946
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.102
Torpedo's ready, sir.

947
00:55:57.813 --> 00:56:00.357
Star Trek ii was classic storytelling.

948
00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:07.530
You had a wonderful actor,

949
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:09.575
Ricardo montalban, Khan.

950
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.412
Why?

951
00:56:13.662 --> 00:56:16.247
Yes, he was a little bit over the top.

952
00:56:16.248 --> 00:56:19.750
But it called for that.

953
00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:22.128
And, you know, bill is no slouch
when it comes

954
00:56:22.129 --> 00:56:25.132
to emoting.

955
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:26.091
Khan!!!

956
00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:30.094
They were a great combination.
The unstoppable force

957
00:56:30.095 --> 00:56:31.221
and the immovable object.

958
00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:33.265
They're locking phasers.
Raise shields. Fire!

959
00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:35.642
Higher!

960
00:56:35.684 --> 00:56:36.726
And that's what you want.

961
00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:38.228
You want that kind of friction.

962
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.272
Higher.

963
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.691
Higher.

964
00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:47.528
They were always at each other's throats.

965
00:56:47.529 --> 00:56:50.991
With terrific character
building and terrific storytelling.

966
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:54.368
I didn't think we could do better.

967
00:56:54.369 --> 00:56:56.371
And who do we have here?

968
00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:58.474
Midshipman first class. Peter
Preston, engineer's mate, sir!

969
00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:02.169
It was the most tension thick
set I've ever been on.

970
00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:06.964
It was a big film because of
the risk Paramount was taking,

971
00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:10.552
even doing the second film
given how the first one was received.

972
00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:12.678
As a matter of cosmic history,

973
00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:15.724
it has always been easier
to destroy than to create.

974
00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:18.393
Bill was always acting like kirk.

975
00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:20.144
He paraded around the set.

976
00:57:20.145 --> 00:57:23.856
He seemed pompous all the time, and
I just realized that he was just trying

977
00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:27.401
to stay in character, and I think Leonard
was doing very much the same thing.

978
00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:29.404
Any chance to go
aboard the enterprise.

979
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.575
George takei was my favorite.

980
00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:38.205
Every single time George was finished
shooting, the door would burst open.

981
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:41.792
All of a sudden we would hear
"sulu got his close up today.“

982
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:46.630
and posture like - like a superhero,
"sulu looked pensively to the right today",

983
00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:52.344
creating some levity on the set, which was
desperately, desperately, desperately

984
00:57:52.427 --> 00:57:53.220
needed.

985
00:57:53.221 --> 00:57:55.722
I need warp speed in three
minutes or we're all dead.

986
00:57:56.515 --> 00:58:01.228
Finding out that Spock actually
does die was ovennhelming.

987
00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:03.062
I thought they can't do this.

988
00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:05.815
They can't do this.
But before the film came out,

989
00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:09.361
everybody knew
that Spock was going to die.

990
00:58:09.778 --> 00:58:13.865
We started getting threats about
"if Spock dies, you die."

991
00:58:14.282 --> 00:58:16.910
This is all before the Internet,
so how people heard about this

992
00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:18.620
I have no idea.

993
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:20.664
The idea of this demise of Spock,

994
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:23.040
which dad just thought was
an interesting idea dramatically,

995
00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:25.961
he wasn't even thinking
about the repercussions.

996
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:28.421
They thought that maybe this
was going to be the last film.

997
00:58:28.422 --> 00:58:30.608
They're going to be two films
and then be done with the franchise.

998
00:58:30.632 --> 00:58:32.634
Live long, and prosper.

999
00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:38.390
He had

1000
00:58:38.391 --> 00:58:41.476
much misgivings after that and regret.

1001
00:58:44.438 --> 00:58:46.690
Oh, by the end, it was like, whoa.

1002
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:49.401
Spock is really going to be dead.

1003
00:58:49.943 --> 00:58:52.571
And I said,
"hell yeah, he's got to be dead.

1004
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:56.490
Othennise, we've taken advantage
of thousands of people for whom

1005
00:58:56.491 --> 00:58:57.992
this is really important stuff.

1006
00:58:57.993 --> 00:59:01.329
And we're going to say at the end
'oh folks, it was just a dry hustle.'"

1007
00:59:01.747 --> 00:59:03.414
that's terrible.

1008
00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:05.625
And I fought it tooth and nail,

1009
00:59:05.834 --> 00:59:09.046
that coffin on the planet,

1010
00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:12.089
and I think I was probably wrong.

1011
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.008
Death was never really death,

1012
00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:19.014
it was always one eye on the box office
in the next incarnation of it.

1013
00:59:19.056 --> 00:59:22.184
I always kind of looked
down my nose at that.

1014
00:59:22.934 --> 00:59:25.478
There's plenty of room.

1015
00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:27.773
They asked me if I wanted
to do Star Trek ill.

1016
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:30.233
And I said, "what is that
going to be about?"

1017
00:59:30.525 --> 00:59:33.570
And they said, "well, it's about,
you know, Spock comes back", I go

1018
00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.531
"resurrection.

1019
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.909
I don't think I know
how to do resurrection."

1020
00:59:39.493 --> 00:59:40.994
So I didn't do it.

1021
00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:49.544
There was a very personal,

1022
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:53.964
intimate nature to a lot of the
very grandiose storytelling

1023
00:59:53.965 --> 00:59:58.470
in the '803, and it was that contrast
that often made them work.

1024
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:01.389
A lot of that can be
attributed to Spielberg.

1025
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:07.229
Steven Spielberg's et.
The extra terrestrial.

1026
01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:11.942
E.t., especially when
you're a child, is such

1027
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:15.487
a roller coaster because you go through
so many different emotions.

1028
01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.197
Can you say e.T.?

1029
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.454
Definitely a tear jerker.

1030
01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:27.749
Eliot.

1031
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.125
When he is hugging
him and saying

1032
01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.712
goodbye, I'm crying, I'm crying.

1033
01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:38.343
I cry every time I see it, every time.

1034
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:43.264
This was supposed to be Steven's
little film in between

1035
01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:45.142
all his big blockbusters.

1036
01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:48.270
All of his films are actually
intensely personal films.

1037
01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.605
He grew up in a broken home.

1038
01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:55.110
His father left, his parents got divorced,
it had a very traumatic effect on him.

1039
01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.779
He's making personal films
about his own life,

1040
01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.158
just that the kind of
canvas is a bigger one.

1041
01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.203
Everything was changing

1042
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:09.666
at that time within our
society, around the family.

1043
01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:14.963
I'm proud that I was able to portray

1044
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.631
one of those four strong mothers.

1045
01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.634
Mommy, he can talk!

1046
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:23.763
Of course he can talk. I'll be right back,
in 10 minutes. Stay there.

1047
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.142
I felt like I was honoring my own mom.

1048
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:34.482
Steven, in a lot of ways is a child.

1049
01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:40.238
That's why I think he responds
and understands the kids

1050
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.574
so well.

1051
01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.493
Only little kids can see him.

1052
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.578
Give me a break.

1053
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.289
There are certain movies
that are just so raw and honest

1054
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:53.501
in their interpretation of youth,
and the kid ensemble in e.T.

1055
01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.003
Is one of those.

1056
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.046
E.t. Found home.

1057
01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.049
My god, he's talking now.

1058
01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.091
We used Reese's pieces

1059
01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:05.597
instead of M&M's, because
M&M's turned us down,

1060
01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:09.476
and said "we don't think
we want to be involved with an alien.“

1061
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.477
oh my god.

1062
01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.772
Would you wanted to be the guy at M&M's

1063
01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.192
who turned down e.T.

1064
01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:20.527
Back in the '803, there were
these latchkey kids

1065
01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:25.033
where you were allowed to go
out and run through the forest.

1066
01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.035
"Back by sunset, darling."

1067
01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.328
Definitely a different time.

1068
01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:30.454
Suburbia,

1069
01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:34.167
your parents were not around
you, involved in your world.

1070
01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:38.213
The adults were these just these things
out there outside of the frame.

1071
01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.257
No TV.

1072
01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.176
The scene where Henry walks down

1073
01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:49.182
and is showing e.T. All the toys,
Steven said, "bring all your toys."

1074
01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.143
So those were all Henry's real toys.

1075
01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:56.606
I think jaws was probably placed in there.

1076
01:02:56.648 --> 01:03:01.444
The shark eats the fish.
Nobody eats the shark.

1077
01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:02.695
I distinctly

1078
01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:07.075
remember the first day
I walked onto the sound stage.

1079
01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:09.326
There was a connection.

1080
01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.746
Steven did the voice when we shot.

1081
01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:17.334
Drew was very young, she really couldn't

1082
01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:21.214
distinguish the difference
between reality and fantasy.

1083
01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:24.259
We would put et. In a corner
when he wasn't working well,

1084
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.218
she would be over talking to him.

1085
01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:29.389
So Steven had two guys

1086
01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.975
whose job it was to at all times

1087
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:37.522
be on e.T. Patrol so that
he could come alive and gertie

1088
01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:41.276
would still not have
to suspend that, that belief.

1089
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.904
We have to shoot his death scene.

1090
01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:49.284
I stooped down and I said, "hi drew.

1091
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:53.371
We're going to go shoot the scene
where e.T. Is dying,

1092
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:58.084
but e.T. Is just acting like
we're acting, right?

1093
01:03:58.126 --> 01:03:59.376
He's not really dying."

1094
01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.337
She goes, "I know, Dee.

1095
01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.756
Do you think I'm stupid?"

1096
01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:07.426
So I picked her up and we walked in.

1097
01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:11.097
She took one look at e.T,

1098
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.682
and went, "he's dying!"

1099
01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.976
Steven's going, "roll it, roll it."

1100
01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:17.979
Clear!

1101
01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.689
We're losing him!

1102
01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.648
The message of the film itself

1103
01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:25.153
was all about love
and friendship and connection.

1104
01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:30.492
It surpasses our brains
and goes straight to our heart.

1105
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.202
The audience was ready for it.

1106
01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.621
The world was ready for it.

1107
01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:39.333
And literally, it's our generation's

1108
01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.044
wizard of oz.

1109
01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.925
Right

1110
01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.135
here.

1111
01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:58.560
The thing about blade runner

1112
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:02.148
that is so powerful for me
is just the visual storytelling.

1113
01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:07.487
The production design,
the cinematography,

1114
01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.614
the choreography is so outstanding,

1115
01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:12.784
it's so beautiful.

1116
01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:16.745
It looks really cool,

1117
01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:20.125
but it is everything we
have warned you against.

1118
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.168
A new life awaits you
in the off-world colonies.

1119
01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:25.754
Ridley Scott's brother,

1120
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:29.300
frank, had died, and one of the reasons
Ridley Scott made blade runner

1121
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.720
because he was trying to work
his grief out, the only way he knew

1122
01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:36.558
which was making a film.
So it was going to be imbued with

1123
01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.726
that darkness.

1124
01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:42.230
Replicants are like any other machine.
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

1125
01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.774
If they're a benefit it's not my problem.

1126
01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:47.193
It's about our own life spans.

1127
01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.196
You were made as well
as we could make you.

1128
01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.240
But not to last.

1129
01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.951
The light that burns twice
as bright, burns half as long.

1130
01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:58.328
If we create a slave race,
does that make us god,

1131
01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:00.790
what is our moral duty to that?

1132
01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.876
What makes us human? Is it memory?

1133
01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:07.839
Incredibly detailed
themes about existence.

1134
01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.841
How can it not know what it is?

1135
01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:12.803
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell. 'More
human than human' is our motto.

1136
01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:18.224
I love the replicants.

1137
01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:20.268
I think, Sebastian,
therefore I am.

1138
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.687
Because they're the most
human characters in the film.

1139
01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:26.274
They've got the most life to them,
and it's kind of an irony.

1140
01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.902
My birthday is April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

1141
01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:30.862
Four years.

1142
01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.948
Something is very human about
them, self-preservation,

1143
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:38.369
wanting to matter,
beyond the role as the slave

1144
01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:41.915
or as a second class citizen,
I mean, this really is

1145
01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.917
anecdotal.

1146
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.461
You think I'm a replicant, don't you?

1147
01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.671
I felt that my character, Rachel,

1148
01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.050
was the heart and soul of that picture.

1149
01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.093
You play beautifully.

1150
01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:00.349
Walking in to do blade runner,
I thought I was going to meet

1151
01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.729
Han Solo. Harrison could be funny
on a dime if he wanted to be.

1152
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.356
But he doesn't take prisoners.

1153
01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:08.858
He say you blade runner.

1154
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.902
Tell him I'm eating.

1155
01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.864
Rediker had a certain
sort of dynamo personality,

1156
01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.701
and the character did as well,
and one of my favorite lines is after

1157
01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.956
he gets hit in the head, he goes,
"that's the spirit!" You know.

1158
01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.958
That's the spirit!

1159
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:28.878
And he made it very iconic.

1160
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.397
Quite an experience to
live in fear, isn't it?

1161
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:33.383
I said to Ridley, why the unicorn?

1162
01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:34.008
And he says, “well,

1163
01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:37.220
I think I'm going to make another movie
after this about unicorns.

1164
01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:41.891
And I don't think this character is
really human and I think he's not human."

1165
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.727
And I went, "really?"

1166
01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:48.605
I don't think they ended up
making that the case because I don't think

1167
01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:52.569
the executives felt that you could have
a leading man that wasn't human.

1168
01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:55.655
I remember seeing blade
runner at a theater

1169
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:59.075
thinking to myself, my god,
what is that narration?

1170
01:07:59.284 --> 01:08:00.451
It's horrible.

1171
01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:05.873
They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession.

1172
01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:06.749
Ex-cop.

1173
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.208
It looked like somebody had

1174
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.712
fooled around with it
other than a director.

1175
01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:13.839
Replicants weren't
supposed to have feelings.

1176
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.842
Neither were blade runners.

1177
01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.969
Ridley Scott shared with me

1178
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.514
the studio was so concerned
that no one was going to know

1179
01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:24.600
what kind of movie they
were watching, that they insisted

1180
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.935
that he put the narration
up at the beginning.

1181
01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.229
This is what he said to me.

1182
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:33.899
He and Harrison conspired with each other
to make it the worst piece of narration

1183
01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:37.738
they could possibly record
in order to get the studio to say,

1184
01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:40.073
"we can't even use this,
it's just so awful."

1185
01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:42.993
The report would be 'routine
retirement of a replicant'.

1186
01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:46.913
Which didn't make me feel any bettter
about shooting a woman in the back.

1187
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.499
But they ended up using it.

1188
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.920
The precedent hadn't been set
for a film like blade runner.

1189
01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.631
I think that was
probably ahead of its time.

1190
01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:58.134
That's sort of the brilliant
part about Ridley,

1191
01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:02.595
he's constantly thinking and imagining
and gripping things up in his mind,

1192
01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:05.223
and that's what makes him
the artist that he is.

1193
01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.143
His brain went there.

1194
01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:09.185
Like

1195
01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.189
tears

1196
01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.399
in rain.

1197
01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:22.198
The good guys always win!

1198
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.202
Even in the '803.

1199
01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:27.578
Ace hunter,

1200
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.999
who I played was just
the ultimate good guy.

1201
01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.627
Hal needham always said it's very simple.

1202
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.421
It's the good guys against the bad guys.

1203
01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:41.803
The original script was more like
a real shoot em up, gi. Joe,

1204
01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.305
you know, slaughter the
enemy kind of movie.

1205
01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:46.849
And hal said, "no, no, I don't
want to do that."

1206
01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:50.352
You can't go up against blade
runner with megaforce

1207
01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:53.479
and think that you're going to
have that same audience.

1208
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:55.817
You know, our audience was
twelve year olds.

1209
01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:09.372
Mattel toys was very influential in
terms of how these vehicles

1210
01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.041
would be designed, colors and shapes.

1211
01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.044
Primary objective, is to trick
guerera to cross the border,

1212
01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:18.089
bringing him in your territory at
a predetermined time and place.

1213
01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:19.799
Hal needham,

1214
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.177
his wife saw me in pirates
of penzance on stage,

1215
01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:27.765
and she went home and said to hal,
“I've got your ace hunter right here."

1216
01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:31.893
When they offered me the part,
we had to make ace hunter

1217
01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:35.565
look exactly like the pirate king
in the pirates of penzance,

1218
01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:41.528
from the headband to the
beard to the hair, this sort of swagger

1219
01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:47.910
and slightly over-the-top superhero
attitude which I like to call overacting.

1220
01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.045
The ace hunter

1221
01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:01.674
outfits and all of the outfits
were designed by mattel toys.

1222
01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:04.801
There wasn't a costume
designer on this movie,

1223
01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:07.054
which is so totally unusual.

1224
01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.600
Spandex, right?

1225
01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:16.481
I think I was stoned most of the time,
if you want to know the truth.

1226
01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.650
And then the ad would come
tap me on the shoulder and say,

1227
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.902
"oh, listen, we need you in an hour."

1228
01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:25.198
Just pour me in the outfit.

1229
01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:29.368
My guys so international in their makeup.

1230
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.915
All the characters in megaforce
were one dimensional characters.

1231
01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.125
And that's part of the fun of it,
because that's what makes it

1232
01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.879
that sort of cartoon.

1233
01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:42.041
But I'll tell you son, we did
raise some kind of hell!

1234
01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:45.843
Edward mulhare, probably better
known aftennards for knight rider,

1235
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:50.723
putting it together that international
fighting for his secretively.

1236
01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.517
He probably didn't pay his taxes.

1237
01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.938
And persis khambatta played Zara.

1238
01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.816
It's too bad that she
wasn't prettier. Huh?

1239
01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:03.568
Jesus, she was gorgeous

1240
01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:06.072
and she had her hair.

1241
01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.074
Kirk unit.

1242
01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:08.741
Kirk unit.

1243
01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.575
I always thought
we were going to make

1244
01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:15.206
a megaforce ii and a megaforce III.
When megaforce I took a dump,

1245
01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.416
we never got to the point of that.

1246
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:23.881
Megaforce deeds, not words I think was
going to be the name of the second one.

1247
01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:27.635
The script is still out there somewhere.

1248
01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:33.557
When anybody mentions megaforce,
they just make fun of it.

1249
01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:36.686
You never make a movie thinking
it's going to be a cult movie.

1250
01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:40.063
Who even knew about cult movies
when we were doing

1251
01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:43.401
rocky horror picture show?

1252
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:47.196
It's not Hamlet, for god sakes.

1253
01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.208
Tron

1254
01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.294
he is a programmer,

1255
01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:06.007
but he gets sucked into this world
and ends up taking the whole system down.

1256
01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:08.342
Woo hoo. Little guy.

1257
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.760
What a concept.

1258
01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.055
What if we went down in there
and it was actually a world?

1259
01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:19.019
I auditioned for star wars.

1260
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.770
I didn't get that one.

1261
01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:25.234
I looked at this and I said, well, it
kind of looks like space. Okay.

1262
01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.195
I felt a part of a pioneering effort.

1263
01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:32.992
And Steven lisberger, the creator
of this, I call him Yoda.

1264
01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:36.161
Everything was hanging on this.

1265
01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.663
That's a lot of responsibility.

1266
01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:42.209
We could miserably fail.

1267
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.922
Or we could wildly succeed.

1268
01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:50.384
If you look at the performances
by Jeff Bridges, Bruce boxleitner,

1269
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:56.223
Cindy Morgan, who had to
act in front of nothing.

1270
01:13:57.558 --> 01:13:59.059
So what am I looking at?

1271
01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.312
Okay, you're looking at the solar sailer.

1272
01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.230
Here's a sketch.

1273
01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.276
We wore hockey

1274
01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.405
helmets and motocross shoulder pads.

1275
01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:14.325
We were wearing what a male
ballet dancer would wear.

1276
01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.995
It was probably the early
thong, male thong.

1277
01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:22.374
Tron was a warrior.

1278
01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.335
He dominated the game grid.

1279
01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.378
Who's that guy?

1280
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.381
That's tron. He fights
for the users.

1281
01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:34.511
I would get my frisbee
and we'd play with our discs like

1282
01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:37.765
just the battles and stuff and
pretend I had a light cycle.

1283
01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:42.686
They loved the light cycles.

1284
01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:43.687
I never saw it.

1285
01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:47.066
It was a stick in front
of me with a crossbar.

1286
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.778
We were all standing there
and they kind of

1287
01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:51.779
we bent over.

1288
01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.155
And that was it.

1289
01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.575
And I did the whole chase like that.

1290
01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.997
Finish the game!

1291
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:05.126
David Warner, who played the villain sark,

1292
01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:09.046
who I had to have my final big battle
with, was not a physical guy.

1293
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.926
So he had to be doubled
through most of it.

1294
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.056
People were encouraged

1295
01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:22.852
to put what they call easter eggs.

1296
01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:27.648
One of the compositors
had put in pac-man.

1297
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.357
We loved it.

1298
01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:32.737
The solar sailer
going over the landscape

1299
01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.698
and seeing the outline of Mickey mouse.

1300
01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.908
What a great idea.

1301
01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:39.951
Alan

1302
01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.954
where did you hear that name?

1303
01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:43.788
Well, that's your name, isn't it?

1304
01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.207
Name of my user.

1305
01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:49.754
There's a theological element
to tron from the perspective

1306
01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:52.839
of the programs inside the
computer, and that question is,

1307
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.176
are the users real?

1308
01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.178
The user even wrote you!

1309
01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.579
No one user wrote me. I'm worth
millions of their man-years.

1310
01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:02.975
Should we believe in the users

1311
01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.854
and use it to resist the oppression
of the master control program?

1312
01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:10.648
It becomes this meditation
on faith, where science

1313
01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:13.444
and theology collide.

1314
01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.446
If you are a user.

1315
01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:18.074
And everything you've done has
been according to the plan, right?

1316
01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.658
You wish.

1317
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.535
When I saw the final product,

1318
01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:24.872
I felt like a proud father.

1319
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:29.251
And it was basically f you
to the rest of Hollywood.

1320
01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.961
You thought we couldn't do it?

1321
01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:32.630
Yeah.

1322
01:16:32.631 --> 01:16:34.673
Well, how do you like us now?

1323
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.134
For those kids

1324
01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.763
in all those arcades throughout
the country, in the world,

1325
01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:45.476
they got it, and I knew then
that we had a revolutionary thing.

1326
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:49.355
It's not going to be appreciated
now, but it will be.

1327
01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.357
End of line.

1328
01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:00.115
The moviegoing experience

1329
01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:05.913
became something that started way before
you could actually go see the movie,

1330
01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:09.667
a movie is a productjust
like Coca-Cola is a product.

1331
01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.710
I did it again.
Catch the wave. Coke.

1332
01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:15.046
It's putting the name in your head

1333
01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:19.218
so that you will think about it
and feel interested in it.

1334
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:20.677
You have to remember

1335
01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:25.182
if it's at all possible, that in the 1980s
there was no such thing as the Internet.

1336
01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:30.270
What we knew of future films
was given to us by the lobby of the cinema

1337
01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:33.149
where we were currently
going to see a film.

1338
01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.194
And it was a thrilling thing.

1339
01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:40.530
There was that little moment
where you looked at the poster

1340
01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.201
and you started to make the film
in your head as you looked at it.

1341
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:45.952
All we had to go on was the title,

1342
01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:50.957
the tagline and the imagery.
I remember that first great image

1343
01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:55.087
from star wars: Luke holding
the lightsabers evocative of medieval,

1344
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:58.632
whether it's the Tom young version
or the hildebrandt brothers version.

1345
01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.718
It was such a powerful
image, and still is.

1346
01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:03.095
Back in those days,

1347
01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:05.806
movie posters were
legitimate works of art.

1348
01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:08.766
Now we know them.

1349
01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:11.729
You know, it's
kind of great range of artists.

1350
01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.274
Bob peak who did all the Star Trek
posters, drew struzan,

1351
01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.441
who's now a legend.

1352
01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:19.111
And Robert mcginnis
and John purkey and others.

1353
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.072
It's a great range of artists
who have become cult

1354
01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:25.826
figures and the whole idea of
science fiction poster art

1355
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.705
has become a collectible
and desirable in its own right.

1356
01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:32.916
Brilliant marketing,

1357
01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:38.005
the Michelangelo picture
has so much meaning to us.

1358
01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:41.967
I thought it was a brilliant
representation of that.

1359
01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.596
Tron was a poster
that was very important to me.

1360
01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:46.930
Great visual idea.

1361
01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:49.683
The thing had a fabulous poster.

1362
01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.769
For me, really, the next level

1363
01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:57.815
in terms of poster art is the vhs box,
because when you went into into

1364
01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:01.195
video stores, that's what you
were using to make your choices.

1365
01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.448
A movie that had been playing
to crickets in theaters

1366
01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:08.369
was now a movie that people thought,
'oh, this must have been a big hit.'

1367
01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:12.247
I think partly because of the appeal of
what was on the box. That transformed

1368
01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:15.584
what people remember about
the success of these pictures.

1369
01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.961
What a distance!

1370
01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:21.507
If you weren't alive in the '803,
you will never know the unbelievable

1371
01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:24.676
high stakes selection

1372
01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:27.721
process at the video store.

1373
01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:31.307
You kind of flipped it around and looked
at some of the words in the background

1374
01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:34.727
and read maybe a few of them and looked
at some of the quotes, "two thumbs up

1375
01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:35.937
Roger ebert", you know?

1376
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:40.442
But it was the image on the front
that made you excited and our hunger

1377
01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:44.321
not only to know
about the worlds of the film,

1378
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:48.951
but also to know about how they made
the worlds of the film began to grow.

1379
01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:50.953
The audience was

1380
01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:54.581
very intelligent, and I said,
"I think we can do a magazine

1381
01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:59.127
that will target people like me
that have been a science fiction fan

1382
01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:03.215
since I was a kid that really covered
all the stuff that I love."

1383
01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:06.302
Geeks grew not out of necessarily

1384
01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:10.556
wanting to be Luke Skywalker, but
because they wanted to be George Lucas.

1385
01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:14.727
They wanted to become filmmakers,
and they wanted to understand film

1386
01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:16.770
as much about the story it told.

1387
01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:20.607
But the story that went on behind
the scenes as well, and this expanded

1388
01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.861
across the 19803.

1389
01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:28.531
I told George Lucas, when I met him,
"your movie made my magazine a success

1390
01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:31.784
because when it came out,
suddenly the whole audience

1391
01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:35.246
for science fiction came alive.

1392
01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:37.123
They want to know

1393
01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:40.210
facts, information, knowledge.

1394
01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.004
That's what we were giving them."

1395
01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:45.132
The starlog, cinefantastique,

1396
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:48.802
cinefex is very much hard
core making of.

1397
01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.262
Premiere.

1398
01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:54.850
Then in 1989 in britain, empire was born,
which I went on to work for.

1399
01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.478
One of the things I did at lucasfilm

1400
01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:04.609
was I started and oversaw
the first few years of the official

1401
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:09.615
star wars fan club, and for far less
money than it cost us to operate,

1402
01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:14.577
you could join and we sent out
a membership kit with an exclusive poster

1403
01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:20.250
and photographs and stuff, and a quarterly
newsletter called bantha tracks.

1404
01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:22.961
We wanted to keep fans
interested and happy.

1405
01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:26.215
Fandom developed around these magazines.

1406
01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:30.177
We created a place for the reader to come

1407
01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:35.099
and pour out their geekdom
and be amongst like minded people.

1408
01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:40.478
There was a point in the '803 when the
marketing and the product placement

1409
01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:44.441
and the sort of eye towards what
these films were going to do beyond

1410
01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:49.029
when you left, the theater would
sometimes overtake the movie themselves.

1411
01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:51.240
Don't you worry.

1412
01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:56.994
Suddenly, you've got

1413
01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:59.623
songs from movies
that are on billboard charts.

1414
01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.543
Ray Parker Jr. from ghostbusters,
that was so fantastic.

1415
01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:06.255
If there's something strange
in your neighborhood

1416
01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:09.340
mtv, they would take a
song from the movie

1417
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.927
and make a video,
and it made it really fun.

1418
01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:13.971
- Who you gonna call?
- Ghostbusters!

1419
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:15.097
You associated

1420
01:22:15.098 --> 01:22:17.975
all those things together
and then you wanted to see the movie.

1421
01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:21.186
It was kind of incredible marketing.

1422
01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:23.229
Look at the stereo.

1423
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.250
No, no, no, don't touch it.
It's not a stereo, it's -

1424
01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:25.983
what is it?

1425
01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:28.569
And this is how films grew in our heads.

1426
01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:31.696
It was a way of enticing you
in. These days, they're much more

1427
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:35.284
like an accompaniment
of the whole hype machine.

1428
01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.326
But we didn't know what hype was.

1429
01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:40.747
I mean, we experienced it without
putting a name on it back in the '80s

1430
01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:45.585
so that's all part of our
advertising and publicity.

1431
01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.336
It just makes sense.

1432
01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.381
Who's going to want to go see this movie?

1433
01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:51.425
Let's let them know about it.

1434
01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.344
I'd buy that for a dollar!

1435
01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.734
Spacehunter

1436
01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:11.737
adventures in the forbidden zone

1437
01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:13.780
in 3-d

1438
01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:18.618
so the first big 3-d science fiction
movie of the '80s was spacehunter

1439
01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:20.746
adventures in the forbidden zone.

1440
01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:27.126
For some reason, all of these '803

1441
01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:30.756
3-d sci fi movies have
really long, wordy titles.

1442
01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:35.302
I remember seeing a lot of these
'8033-d movies in the theater.

1443
01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:38.597
I was their target audience.

1444
01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:41.266
I was the one who sort of pitched

1445
01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:44.353
doing it in 3-d.

1446
01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:47.314
I thought the title was right.

1447
01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.527
It is the kind of science
fiction exploitation movie

1448
01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:55.030
that was popular at the time.

1449
01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:59.492
Three women have crashed

1450
01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:03.247
landed on this planet
and they get captured.

1451
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:07.876
Michael Ironside

1452
01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:10.963
is the villain in this film,
his role is the over dog.

1453
01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:15.383
I imagine he hated the makeup process,
but enjoyed the scenery eating.

1454
01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:18.387
Ah, you can't hurt me.

1455
01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:21.306
But I can hurt you.

1456
01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:24.643
Peter Strauss plays the pilot,
the Han Solo knockoff character.

1457
01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:26.353
Whatever you say, Princess.

1458
01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:29.647
Molly ringwald, who at this point in
time is very pre-brat pack plays

1459
01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:32.985
Niki, a sort of an urchin pain
in the butt character.

1460
01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:34.987
What the hell are you?

1461
01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:38.031
What do you think I am, you
scrawny earthbag? I'm a woman!

1462
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.449
A pre ghostbusters, Ernie
Hudson is in this movie

1463
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:44.580
as a rival smuggler slash
pilot, opportunistic guy, and they end up

1464
01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.165
one up in each other through the film
before coming together.

1465
01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:50.168
Just look at it.
Look at what you did!

1466
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.213
It's ruined!

1467
01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:56.341
There's a lot of location shooting,
some very impressive landscapes.

1468
01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:59.428
They really make it look bigger
than it has any right to be.

1469
01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.180
John LaFleur was the young

1470
01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:07.227
Canadian filmmaker
that sort of invented this story

1471
01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:11.064
initially, but he had very
little film experience.

1472
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.861
He fell behind very quickly
and we had to make a change

1473
01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.697
in our filmmakers and
we found lamont Johnson.

1474
01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.951
His concept was to try to make it
as realistic as possible

1475
01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:26.830
and sort of didn't take
advantage of the fun of it.

1476
01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.211
I felt that spacehunter was
a little bit of a lost

1477
01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:38.424
opportunity finally, given the cast and
the concept and the re-use of native 3-d.

1478
01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:42.471
Using two cameras,
using two projectors to show it

1479
01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.557
kind of impossible
from a commercial standpoint

1480
01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:47.350
in terms of exhibition.

1481
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:48.893
But it really looked beautiful

1482
01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:52.814
when you could see it
in its original form.

1483
01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.816
Lift the gates! Begin!

1484
01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:00.530
Star wars

1485
01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:02.783
had this wonderful level of authenticity.

1486
01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:07.579
Just required a lot less
of that suspension of disbelief.

1487
01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.748
That was a real revolution
in storytelling.

1488
01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.501
What cinema could do and
storytelling could do,

1489
01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:17.546
and the connection with the audience
can do, was absolutely at its height.

1490
01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:22.052
I think that even for Lucas, the
expectation became unattainably high.

1491
01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:27.683
There's stuff in jedi

1492
01:26:27.684 --> 01:26:30.894
that is absolutely masterful
that I have really fond memories of.

1493
01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.982
Get alongside that one.

1494
01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.316
The chase through the forest,

1495
01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:41.196
which is like an epic piece of cinema.

1496
01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:45.283
I love that sequence so much.

1497
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:52.874
I did go see return of the jedi
23 times in the theater.

1498
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.545
The sarlacc pit and jabba's
is going to throw them all in there,

1499
01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.756
but Luke's got the plan with r2.

1500
01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:08.723
You'd think that there would have been

1501
01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:12.394
this big battle with Boba Fett
and someone and han, right?

1502
01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:18.108
He just gets like accidentally rocket
packed into the side of jabba's

1503
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.192
big space cruiser.

1504
01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.195
And becomes a burp joke.

1505
01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:25.782
Boba Fett

1506
01:27:25.783 --> 01:27:30.370
first showed up in the star wars
holiday special in the animated sequence.

1507
01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:36.917
He was supposed to be the main villain

1508
01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:41.465
in the movie that turned out
to be called return of the jedi.

1509
01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:46.470
It was all going to be about
chasing boba, rescuing Han Solo.

1510
01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.806
But during the making
of empire, George decided

1511
01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:55.020
he did not want to make
more star wars movies.

1512
01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:58.314
I was sitting with him
in a sound mixing room,

1513
01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:01.859
and he told me that he'd made
this decision and was going to end,

1514
01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.530
and that's why he was going
to condense the third trilogy

1515
01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:09.826
and the redemption of Darth Vader
into return of the jedi.

1516
01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.204
And then, boba

1517
01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:15.915
he went from going to be a big star

1518
01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:19.211
to an afterthought.

1519
01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.754
When we came onto the set,

1520
01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:24.424
they had these shirts
that said blue harvest.

1521
01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:30.180
Sort of like just a distraction
for the local people that they wouldn't

1522
01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.724
find out that we were
doing a star wars movie

1523
01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:36.560
the first time we go out to dinner
and Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, my father,

1524
01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:38.604
you know, Harrison Ford,
are having dinner together.

1525
01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:41.191
They're going to figure it out real quick.

1526
01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:44.194
Corey and I have always
been very, very close.

1527
01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:47.197
He traveled a lot with
me whenever I did movies,

1528
01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.200
stood in for me.

1529
01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:53.035
The opportunity to be
a part of the star wars

1530
01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.664
franchise was - couldn't overlook that.

1531
01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.459
When he fell into the pit,

1532
01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.672
han is trying to shoot
the tentacle off of his leg.

1533
01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:07.092
An explosive charge went
off and went into his foot.

1534
01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.135
And burned his foot,

1535
01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:13.849
so they put me in lando's
outfit, they hung me over the side.

1536
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.330
They didn't tell me all these
explosions were going to happen.

1537
01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:18.478
I guess they got a
genuine reaction out of me.

1538
01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:23.066
And then they needed someone
to put on klaatu's mask.

1539
01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:24.942
He was just a random creature.

1540
01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:28.320
He was going to run towards
Skywalker, get into a quick skirmish,

1541
01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:30.782
and I couldn't see a thing.

1542
01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:34.619
It was sort of like a random
last minute thing.

1543
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.997
And here I am, an action figure.

1544
01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:41.250
The big battle at the end,

1545
01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:45.380
the death star and then everyone
on endor waiting for, you know, han

1546
01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.925
will get that shield down,
we got to give him more time.

1547
01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:51.343
Go Billy Dee.

1548
01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:53.054
We've got to give him more time.

1549
01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:55.347
I did seven stunts

1550
01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:59.226
for seven different ewoks.
Every time Dave tomlin,

1551
01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:03.106
who was the first assistant director
goes, “deep get into the suit.”

1552
01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:05.232
I said, "but I just got killed"

1553
01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.553
he said, "got to do another one."

1554
01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.447
When I watched jedi, I was like this.

1555
01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:14.868
Just leaning fonnard, and I think the true
moviegoers posture, right, like that.

1556
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.952
So what we have here
is a linking of almost a child's

1557
01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:19.831
imagination with all the technology
at the command of a movie maker.

1558
01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:25.336
These movies take us from childhood
into an era where we're growing up.

1559
01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:28.048
We're changing,
they're indelibly connected.

1560
01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:31.508
It was this huge part of my life.

1561
01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:33.719
We certainly never thought

1562
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.431
we were going to get
any more of these movies.

1563
01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:42.561
What I think George Lucas did
amazingly was to show that it was possible

1564
01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:46.649
to execute these grand visions
with a level of believability

1565
01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:48.985
that was something
we haven't really seen before.

1566
01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:55.407
There are a lot of filmmakers
that were really inspired

1567
01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:58.411
and freed by what George
had done on star wars.

1568
01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:03.291
You got immersed into it and you
believed it and that was really wonderful.

1569
01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:19.307
Is this a game or is it real?

1570
01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:20.642
Wargames

1571
01:31:20.684 --> 01:31:23.436
what happens when you play a
thermonuclear war as a game,

1572
01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:27.107
but it actually connects to NORAD?

1573
01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:30.610
I love the what if of it.

1574
01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:33.822
I have seven, correction, eight, that's
eight redbirds two degrees past...

1575
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:36.740
There was another film

1576
01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.952
before wargames, colossus.

1577
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:43.747
The good guys, us have these
supercomputers, and the bad guys,

1578
01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:46.626
the Russians have these
supercomputers and they connected.

1579
01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:51.088
So all of a sudden,
this artificial intelligence started

1580
01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:54.008
to make decisions for us because
we're so immature and violent

1581
01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:54.592
and all that.

1582
01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:57.720
We will work together. Unwillingly at
first on your part. But that will pass.

1583
01:31:57.721 --> 01:31:59.723
But that will pass.

1584
01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:01.682
What a lot of these movies

1585
01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:04.644
were doing is trying to
hew as closely as they could

1586
01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:09.190
to things that might actually happen
and then play them out.

1587
01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:12.235
In the most frightening way
that they can think of.

1588
01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:14.612
They wanted it to look and feel real.

1589
01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:16.655
The whopper has only fought
world war ii! As a game

1590
01:32:16.656 --> 01:32:18.658
time and time again.

1591
01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:23.246
Wargames, it's a really
smart little movie.

1592
01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:28.292
What it took was the growing
fascination in the early 1980s

1593
01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:32.047
with computers, the home
computer became a thing.

1594
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:35.466
They barely had 10k in them at the time,
but they were the most wonderful

1595
01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:36.217
things in the universe.

1596
01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:37.844
You're really in to computers, huh?

1597
01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:39.888
Yeah.

1598
01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.849
You could dial into a computer
and see stuff you weren't supposed to see.

1599
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:46.102
Oh, oh yes.

1600
01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:48.104
What are you doing?

1601
01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.148
I'm changing your biology grade.

1602
01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.792
No, I don't want you to do that,
you're going to bet me in trouble.

1603
01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:52.816
Nobody can find out.

1604
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.153
Forbidden knowledge, bring that on.

1605
01:32:56.696 --> 01:32:59.824
He was a great geek kid, Matthew
Broderick. The kid at home

1606
01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:05.662
can through the phone line, no less,
link up to some giant mainframe

1607
01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:09.000
that operates all of the
nuclear weapons in america.

1608
01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:11.836
This is kind of feasible
somehow in our brains.

1609
01:33:11.878 --> 01:33:13.378
This is what computers do.

1610
01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:15.423
And he could be starting world war III.

1611
01:33:15.465 --> 01:33:17.425
Shall we play a game?

1612
01:33:17.467 --> 01:33:19.469
How about global thermonuclear war?

1613
01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:22.631
Josh was trying to find the right code
so he could launch the missiles himself.

1614
01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.434
It's really suspenseful.

1615
01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:30.312
They're trying to divine

1616
01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:33.066
how to beat this supercomputer
at its own game.

1617
01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:35.109
Come on.

1618
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.112
Learn, goddamn it!

1619
01:33:37.946 --> 01:33:40.781
It was science out of control film

1620
01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:44.160
but it keyed in to that permanent
fear that was going on.

1621
01:33:44.911 --> 01:33:47.330
Normal kids and nuclear threat.

1622
01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:49.707
I think I auditioned for
wargames about six times.

1623
01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:54.295
The original script was much
darker and much more scary,

1624
01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:58.550
and the guy was more of an isolated
kind of loner who worked at radioshack.

1625
01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.096
Wargames scared people so much

1626
01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:09.144
that there were actual computer
hackers who were put in jail.

1627
01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:13.565
Kevin mitnick was put in jail
and not given access to a payphone

1628
01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:17.401
because some idiot
senator believed that he could,

1629
01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:20.822
using his voice and a pay phone,
launch a nuclear missile.

1630
01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:24.534
You can watch wargames today,
particularly today,

1631
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:30.665
as the nation is being hacked
by Russian operatives every 25 seconds.

1632
01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:33.334
And that movie don't seem silly at all.

1633
01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:35.336
How about a nice game of chess?

1634
01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:45.554
The Superman movies

1635
01:34:45.555 --> 01:34:48.600
are absolutely special to me.

1636
01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:52.770
Christopher reeve
was so phenomena! In the part.

1637
01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:58.400
Every time a franchise tries
to carry the story on, it's fraught with

1638
01:34:58.401 --> 01:34:59.777
difficulty.

1639
01:34:59.819 --> 01:35:03.406
This time is going to be
the best time of all.

1640
01:35:04.908 --> 01:35:06.909
Superman III encapsulates

1641
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:10.788
so many different genres in one film.

1642
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:11.748
Oh, I'm sorry.

1643
01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:14.459
It was a comedy vehicle for Richard pryor.

1644
01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:17.212
It was an action adventure Superman film.

1645
01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:21.049
It touched upon contemporary
technology of computers.

1646
01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.092
Getting down to business.

1647
01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:26.470
Richard had been in

1648
01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.848
some kind of hero with margot kidder.

1649
01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:33.603
Richard got a chance to do some
drama playing a returned Vietnam vet,

1650
01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:36.355
and he really was hoping
that he would get the chance

1651
01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:38.899
to do something like that
in Superman III.

1652
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.695
But that's not what they
had in mind for him.

1653
01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:47.575
Robert Vaughn plays
the villain in the film

1654
01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:50.912
and puts Richard pryor's
character to work for him.

1655
01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:52.956
I asked you to kill a Superman.

1656
01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:57.459
And you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

1657
01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.503
Annette O'Toole playing Lana lang,

1658
01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:03.800
sort of replacing Lois Lane
as Superman, Clark's

1659
01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:06.260
love interest in the film.

1660
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.762
Lois, say hello to Lana lang,

1661
01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:08.721
Smallville's newest
gift to Metropolis.

1662
01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:10.639
They were really trying to experiment

1663
01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.269
and dig deeper into who Superman was.

1664
01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:19.106
The part of the movie of going,
yeah, man, that's heavy, I don't

1665
01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:20.190
I don't know how you hold

1666
01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:24.112
the weight of the entire world
and everyone's fate in your hands,

1667
01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:28.365
as one being, I don't care how much
super strength you get from the sun.

1668
01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:32.119
Like, there's got to be a point
where you break, right?

1669
01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.288
Literally break in two.

1670
01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:35.665
We see

1671
01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:39.794
Superman, Chris reeve, Clark
Kent, battling his darker self.

1672
01:36:41.337 --> 01:36:43.714
Dealing with his demons, dealing
with who he is, dealing

1673
01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:46.301
with the weight of being Superman.

1674
01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:51.221
It was a very interesting
infusion of a different kind of

1675
01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:53.558
sci fi into a superhero movie.

1676
01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:00.773
A massive supercomputer at the end

1677
01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:04.777
that produces a cyborg,
which is absolutely terrifying.

1678
01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:10.532
The computer digging into her
arms, basically taking over

1679
01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:13.660
and turning her into a sort
of robot Android, it's

1680
01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:16.456
a very, very scary moment.

1681
01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:18.457
If you're young enough,
that could be pretty

1682
01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:20.585
damn traumatizing.

1683
01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:25.630
A lot of folks felt that the
real problem of the third

1684
01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:29.135
Superman film is that it did not live
inside the Superman universe at all.

1685
01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:33.138
Richard donner had wanted to
and worked on a script.

1686
01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:37.142
It involved brainiac and mxyzptlk
and all sorts of other characters

1687
01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:40.855
from the Superman universe,
including an introduction of Supergirl.

1688
01:37:41.981 --> 01:37:45.234
They came around to making
Richard and Superman buds.

1689
01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:46.401
They kind of give each other

1690
01:37:46.402 --> 01:37:50.156
five at the end of the movie,
which is very, very cool of Superman

1691
01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:53.450
back in the day. But the movie
itself just really didn't

1692
01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:54.577
come together.

1693
01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:01.666
Superman III,

1694
01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:04.045
not the best of the Superman films,

1695
01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:08.216
but it's better than Superman iv.

1696
01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:23.606
Strange invaders

1697
01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:28.277
I love the script of strange invaders.

1698
01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:30.571
I fell in love with it
the minute I read it.

1699
01:38:32.365 --> 01:38:34.116
Bill condon was the writer.

1700
01:38:34.117 --> 01:38:35.325
I always thought that bill

1701
01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:37.566
should have directed that film
and he had never directed.

1702
01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.832
So clever, so fun.

1703
01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:45.752
You know, a great send up of '50s
sci fi films, those little nods

1704
01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:47.796
to films were really
right there in the script.

1705
01:38:47.797 --> 01:38:50.507
I want you to look at them
and tell me if you see anything

1706
01:38:50.508 --> 01:38:53.344
that reminds you of the creature
you saw last night.

1707
01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:56.931
The picture of Spielberg, you know, is
this an alien, that's really my favorite.

1708
01:38:56.973 --> 01:39:02.353
I'm sorry, Mr. Bigelow, just a
little joke we have around here.

1709
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:06.065
It's a film that doesn't take
itself too seriously.

1710
01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:11.112
According to what we have, no one
has lived in that town since 1958.

1711
01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:15.324
I do believe that for Paul le mat
it was probably the greatest challenge.

1712
01:39:15.658 --> 01:39:19.453
That particular role,
I don't think it was necessarily something

1713
01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:22.373
that he fell into very comfortably,

1714
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:25.168
but we brought him along for the ride.

1715
01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:28.503
But I'm a scientist,
I know what I saw.

1716
01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:30.005
I loved my character.

1717
01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:33.968
You know, smoking the cigarets
and with a trashy newspaper.

1718
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:38.473
Two-headed dogs, maybe.
But aliens are passe.

1719
01:39:38.556 --> 01:39:41.057
She's fun because there's
really no boundaries

1720
01:39:41.058 --> 01:39:42.685
with this character.

1721
01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:45.438
And there was an alien in my apartment
who gobbled up my soup.

1722
01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:46.314
It sounds ridiculous.

1723
01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:48.483
It was a kind of a no holds barred set.

1724
01:39:48.524 --> 01:39:51.819
I mean, there really wasn't
a lot of direction, if you will.

1725
01:39:52.028 --> 01:39:54.739
All of those wonderful actors
that were thrown together

1726
01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:57.074
really got it and had a good time with it.

1727
01:39:58.117 --> 01:40:01.077
Wallace Shawn, he was so excited
because he hadn't really done

1728
01:40:01.078 --> 01:40:04.040
any acting, and here he is,
this great playwright.

1729
01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:06.959
All he wanted to do was act,
he was so thrilled.

1730
01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:10.421
He said, "I can't believe I'm here
acting in this movie."

1731
01:40:10.505 --> 01:40:13.508
He was willing to do anything,
looking for the next shot, you know?

1732
01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.385
The funny thing

1733
01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:20.306
for me that Kenneth tobey had
a wild crush on Diana scannid

1734
01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:23.391
it was probably more fun than

1735
01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:24.769
it should have been.

1736
01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:32.651
That film, for me is a heartbreak,
because even though people like it

1737
01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:34.402
and enjoy it, I do feel like

1738
01:40:34.403 --> 01:40:36.864
I know what it could have been
with a different director.

1739
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:39.991
It does have a very lighthearted tone

1740
01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:42.745
contrasted with really scary alien makeup.

1741
01:40:43.996 --> 01:40:45.247
It was done really well.

1742
01:40:45.248 --> 01:40:49.000
I remember being really impressed
and stunned when I saw it

1743
01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:52.964
because they had no budget on this film.

1744
01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.131
That does scare you,

1745
01:40:55.132 --> 01:40:58.970
but mostly you're really having fun.

1746
01:41:10.022 --> 01:41:13.233
In the early '803, there was
this wonderful explosion

1747
01:41:13.234 --> 01:41:17.071
of highly imaginative,
highly ambitious science fiction.

1748
01:41:17.697 --> 01:41:20.699
Suddenly, all sorts of stories
that were prohibitive because

1749
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:23.911
technologically they weren't possible,
were suddenly possible now.

1750
01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.707
What star wars did,

1751
01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:32.043
both in terms of the visual effects,
but also George's approach

1752
01:41:32.044 --> 01:41:34.422
to the storytelling aspect of it.

1753
01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:38.092
Was it opened up the
door for genre films

1754
01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:41.387
that people had been
afraid to make before.

1755
01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.349
It's driven by the story,

1756
01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:50.104
the tools that we had were capable
of certain levels of finish,

1757
01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:55.734
and then it was an artistic
interpretation of how the illusion

1758
01:41:55.735 --> 01:41:58.696
was going to fit into the bigger
story, which was really critical.

1759
01:42:02.241 --> 01:42:02.867
There's something

1760
01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:08.164
about the real feel of the thing
and seeing it that brings you into it.

1761
01:42:08.372 --> 01:42:11.625
If you look at it as something that's
a visual effect and it doesn't quite work,

1762
01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:12.667
you're out of it.

1763
01:42:12.668 --> 01:42:15.503
When it works, it really does work.

1764
01:42:15.504 --> 01:42:18.215
The job of a visual effects
supervisor at ilm

1765
01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:21.677
is to be able to fulfill the
vision of the director.

1766
01:42:22.094 --> 01:42:27.515
Also, the effects supervisor
should contribute something to the film

1767
01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:28.309
if they can,

1768
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:32.146
if it's not inappropriate, that possibly
the director didn't even know he could do.

1769
01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:35.316
Always, always

1770
01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:37.484
it starts with the idea
of the finished shot.

1771
01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:39.528
I'm motivated by the finished shot.

1772
01:42:43.115 --> 01:42:45.117
The shots that are magic

1773
01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:48.829
are the ones that have good
design embodied in them.

1774
01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:53.626
Star Trek ii the battle in the nebula

1775
01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:56.754
that was all shot in
cloud tanks here at ilm.

1776
01:42:58.422 --> 01:43:02.551
Beautiful taste is being exhibited
there with compositions of

1777
01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:07.640
where the ships are, the shot designs,
how they're lit, how the clouds swirl.

1778
01:43:07.890 --> 01:43:10.393
That's just some of the
most beautiful work

1779
01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:12.812
that ilm's ever done.

1780
01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:15.814
Miniatures were defined to

1781
01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:18.234
a certain extent
by how they had to be used.

1782
01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:22.821
If you look at the star destroyer, scale
notwithstanding, the model had to be

1783
01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:26.116
incredibly highly detailed
to stand up to that

1784
01:43:26.117 --> 01:43:28.119
kind of macro photography.

1785
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.454
And when we started
blowing stuff up,

1786
01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:35.209
we had to build things
in a little bit larger scale

1787
01:43:35.292 --> 01:43:39.213
so that we could photograph them
at high speed photographic rates.

1788
01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:42.757
The bigger the model,

1789
01:43:42.758 --> 01:43:46.010
the more properly scaled the explosion

1790
01:43:46.011 --> 01:43:47.513
appeared to be.

1791
01:43:51.183 --> 01:43:52.684
Every optical composite

1792
01:43:52.685 --> 01:43:56.020
was a performance.
The way that we used to put

1793
01:43:56.021 --> 01:43:59.482
together a shot of a bunch of spaceships,
you didn't shoot them all at once.

1794
01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.109
You shot them one at a time.

1795
01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:03.904
There's a really remarkable shot
in return of the jedi,

1796
01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:07.699
and it's remarkable for the
huge number of separately

1797
01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.617
photographed spaceships
that are all in there.

1798
01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:11.828
It was intended to be a wow moment.

1799
01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:13.955
And it really accomplished that.

1800
01:44:13.956 --> 01:44:17.501
It's kind of ovennhelming when you think
about the mechanical complexity

1801
01:44:17.585 --> 01:44:21.547
of all those separately
photographed elements.

1802
01:44:23.215 --> 01:44:27.051
The thought process that goes
in to breaking down the barriers

1803
01:44:27.052 --> 01:44:30.264
that we have for this component,
that component, and how do you do this.

1804
01:44:30.514 --> 01:44:31.514
Those are strong.

1805
01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.684
We came up with this

1806
01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:38.355
system called go motion,
which is kind of a joke.

1807
01:44:38.522 --> 01:44:41.817
We didn't know what to call it, so we
called it the opposite of stop motion.

1808
01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:47.031
The first time we used go motion
was on the tauntaun and it totally worked.

1809
01:44:47.156 --> 01:44:49.450
It gave a blur to the thing.

1810
01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:53.995
That was effective.

1811
01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:57.041
Then on dragonslayer,
we developed it further.

1812
01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:02.962
In jedi with the two legged Walker,
when the ewoks rolled

1813
01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:06.633
the lodge down the hill,
go motion allowed me

1814
01:45:06.634 --> 01:45:08.052
to do that.

1815
01:45:10.346 --> 01:45:13.015
And that was really complicated.

1816
01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:18.771
You get into the zone.

1817
01:45:19.021 --> 01:45:22.774
You know, it's a form of
meditation to shut the world out

1818
01:45:22.775 --> 01:45:27.863
and be in the zone, you know,
and do it, do what it tells you.

1819
01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:29.824
I'm walking by and it's

1820
01:45:30.908 --> 01:45:31.659
shh, very quite.

1821
01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.911
It'd be Dennis muren at the camera.

1822
01:45:33.953 --> 01:45:34.953
Click.

1823
01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:38.415
And then all these hatches opened up

1824
01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:42.627
and out came Jon burge and Phil tippett,

1825
01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:47.550
and then move it ever so slightly
and then disappear down the hatch.

1826
01:45:48.634 --> 01:45:49.718
Click.

1827
01:45:55.641 --> 01:45:56.975
Matte painting,

1828
01:45:56.976 --> 01:46:00.729
as a way of adding on
to a set by painting,

1829
01:46:01.856 --> 01:46:04.190
for example, on a piece of glass.

1830
01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:07.277
Not only is it a budget
saving device,

1831
01:46:07.278 --> 01:46:11.490
it's an opportunity to enhance.

1832
01:46:12.157 --> 01:46:14.701
You're working on something
that is supposed to be

1833
01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:16.078
invisible.

1834
01:46:18.622 --> 01:46:21.958
Ghostbusters ii is the film I was
working on, where I said to myself

1835
01:46:21.959 --> 01:46:26.547
at the end of this, we've really reached
the end of traditional visual effects.

1836
01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:28.840
We can't keep doing it this way.

1837
01:46:28.841 --> 01:46:33.137
The ideas are getting bigger
than the toolbox we have.

1838
01:46:34.805 --> 01:46:37.891
Fortunately, in ilm, we had
a computer group

1839
01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:41.854
that had been working on computer
graphics and I had jumped into that.

1840
01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:44.522
I did young Sherlock Holmes
with them.

1841
01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:47.610
That really proved to me
that this is the future.

1842
01:46:50.029 --> 01:46:52.406
It needed more time for the technology,

1843
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.450
both the hardware and the
software to get up to the level

1844
01:46:55.451 --> 01:46:57.535
where we can actually make
it a productive tool,

1845
01:46:57.536 --> 01:47:00.539
which we experimented again with
on the abyss, Jim Cameron's film.

1846
01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:04.543
Water weenie is the way
that we've respectfully

1847
01:47:04.627 --> 01:47:05.753
talked about.

1848
01:47:09.006 --> 01:47:10.798
Seeing things like tron

1849
01:47:10.799 --> 01:47:14.511
and last starfighter,
I thought computer graphics is coming.

1850
01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:17.806
It's not quite ready,
but something to keep your eye on.

1851
01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:23.145
The last starfighter used digital effects.

1852
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:26.065
It was the first one to use it
for the entire film.

1853
01:47:28.025 --> 01:47:30.786
When you look back at it now,
there are some really some growing pains

1854
01:47:30.861 --> 01:47:33.863
and you can see where things
were not as effective

1855
01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:38.160
as it would have been if you got models.
You didn't know if it was going to work.

1856
01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:39.495
So it was a gamble.

1857
01:47:40.579 --> 01:47:41.788
It's a good example

1858
01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:45.751
of the beginnings of cgi.

1859
01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:48.211
My brother, Jeff, is a
visual effects supervisor,

1860
01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:51.340
and he worked on tron doing the bit.

1861
01:47:52.758 --> 01:47:55.593
So he was one of the first cgi
artists, and later

1862
01:47:55.594 --> 01:47:59.515
I worked with him on flight
of the navigator, where he helped me

1863
01:48:00.349 --> 01:48:04.895
design the spaceship morphing
and reflectance mapping.

1864
01:48:05.729 --> 01:48:07.647
This is the flying version of the ship.

1865
01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:10.150
And behind there is the
hovering version of the ship.

1866
01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:15.489
It was a maquette, meaning that
we took a computer and we touched it

1867
01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:19.118
all along here to create the wire frame

1868
01:48:19.618 --> 01:48:23.955
that was then used to wrap
the backgrounds on.

1869
01:48:23.956 --> 01:48:27.876
Shortly after the lucasfilm computer
division had been sold off as pixar,

1870
01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:32.088
we saw that there was a lot of value
in that tech and that this had a big

1871
01:48:32.089 --> 01:48:33.424
future in visual effects.

1872
01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:39.178
Star Trek iv, that hallucination
scene was just about

1873
01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:42.433
the first foray of the island
computer graphics department.

1874
01:48:43.058 --> 01:48:47.061
And that was always the carrot for me
and the promise back in the early '803

1875
01:48:47.062 --> 01:48:49.773
that this is what it could do,
you know, and we're there,

1876
01:48:50.107 --> 01:48:54.486
but it moved too quick, and I think
there hasn't been enough recognition

1877
01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:58.657
that it needs to fit within
the imperfect world of reality.

1878
01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:00.700
"But I can make it perfect", you know.

1879
01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:04.246
No, don't make it perfect.

1880
01:49:04.913 --> 01:49:07.623
Sometimes understanding those limitations

1881
01:49:07.624 --> 01:49:10.544
becomes key to capturing a feeling.

1882
01:49:11.628 --> 01:49:14.715
The '803 represents
an era of a lot of bravery.

1883
01:49:15.174 --> 01:49:19.136
The filmmakers were pushing
new techniques, trying new things.

1884
01:49:19.553 --> 01:49:21.638
Some of them worked great
and some of them didn't.

1885
01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:26.392
Some of them really show their age today,
but there's something kind of wonderful

1886
01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:30.147
about that, that they were fearless
about the things that they would try.

1887
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:53.211
Star Trek III:
The search for Spock

1888
01:49:53.212 --> 01:49:56.215
the adventure continues

1889
01:49:56.465 --> 01:49:58.633
I believe that the major
theme that runs through

1890
01:49:58.634 --> 01:50:01.970
Star Trek III is one
of family and sacrifice.

1891
01:50:02.012 --> 01:50:04.014
Have some friends.

1892
01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:08.476
If you count Spock, the seven
people have been through

1893
01:50:08.477 --> 01:50:12.231
so much together and they've
faced down death together.

1894
01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:16.192
We are now at a point
where a decision that has to be

1895
01:50:16.193 --> 01:50:18.403
made is going to cost them dearly.

1896
01:50:18.445 --> 01:50:21.824
If there's even a chance that
Spock has an eternal soul,

1897
01:50:22.032 --> 01:50:24.535
then it's my responsibility.

1898
01:50:24.576 --> 01:50:25.869
Yours?

1899
01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:26.870
Kirk, in particular,

1900
01:50:26.871 --> 01:50:29.206
has to make tremendous
sacrifices during this film.

1901
01:50:29.248 --> 01:50:34.211
My god, bones...
What have I done?

1902
01:50:35.129 --> 01:50:36.212
Christopher Lloyd

1903
01:50:36.213 --> 01:50:39.299
as the klingon commander is
an interesting casting choice.

1904
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:41.718
You, will tell me the secret

1905
01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.847
of the Genesis torpedo.

1906
01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.349
He just sinks himself
right into that role.

1907
01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.936
He chews scenery just as
well as William shatner does.

1908
01:50:51.937 --> 01:50:55.356
You fool! Look around you!
The planet's destroying itself!

1909
01:50:55.357 --> 01:50:57.693
Yes! Exhilarating, isn't it?

1910
01:50:57.734 --> 01:51:01.279
You realize just how versatile an actor
he was to go from reverend Jim

1911
01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:04.783
to this and then, you know, a year
later, he's in back to the future.

1912
01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:09.163
Leonard, he took Spock to heart.

1913
01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:11.790
I mean, really, really took him to heart.

1914
01:51:12.374 --> 01:51:15.502
As soon as he passed that
gate with the word

1915
01:51:16.128 --> 01:51:20.174
Paramount scrawled on
top of it, he became Mr. Spock.

1916
01:51:20.215 --> 01:51:23.134
Spock brought a lot of opportunity
to Leonard nimoy.

1917
01:51:23.135 --> 01:51:24.719
There's no doubt about it.

1918
01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.221
But does he need Spock? No.

1919
01:51:28.807 --> 01:51:30.308
When Star Trek III came along,

1920
01:51:30.309 --> 01:51:31.268
I think

1921
01:51:31.269 --> 01:51:34.020
he was more than willing to walk away
unless he had something more

1922
01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:37.607
challenging to do, which was direct.

1923
01:51:37.608 --> 01:51:41.110
What I recall is Michael eisner
trying to talk

1924
01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:46.408
Leonard out of directing himself,
making his directing debut.

1925
01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:49.661
Leonard's calling me up
and I said, "are you prepared

1926
01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:51.914
to let the ship sail without you?"

1927
01:51:53.207 --> 01:51:54.624
And he said, "absolutely"

1928
01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:56.394
I said, "then sit tight, you're
going to direct the movie."

1929
01:51:56.418 --> 01:51:58.336
If he says he's not going
to be in the movie

1930
01:51:58.337 --> 01:52:00.881
unless he gets the director,
he'll get the director.

1931
01:52:01.465 --> 01:52:02.798
Period, the end.

1932
01:52:02.799 --> 01:52:05.092
Spock is the linchpin of it.

1933
01:52:05.093 --> 01:52:08.512
He would say to me repeatedly,
“the studio really only understands

1934
01:52:08.513 --> 01:52:10.139
a two by four to the head."

1935
01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:12.559
What they understand is leverage,
and he had leverage.

1936
01:52:12.768 --> 01:52:14.685
They realized that their box office
is going to be bigger

1937
01:52:14.686 --> 01:52:16.145
if Spock appears in the film.

1938
01:52:16.146 --> 01:52:18.147
They kept the thumbscrews on him.

1939
01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:22.401
Jeff Katzenberg looked over his shoulder
every day to make sure he was on time

1940
01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:23.778
and on budget.

1941
01:52:23.779 --> 01:52:26.239
The fact is, he had no experience other

1942
01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.784
than directing some episodes
of TV, including t.J. Hooker,

1943
01:52:29.785 --> 01:52:33.247
you know, other than that,
he was a neophyte.

1944
01:52:34.915 --> 01:52:36.707
I didn't know what we were in for.

1945
01:52:36.708 --> 01:52:39.086
Leonard directed by omission,

1946
01:52:40.921 --> 01:52:43.257
if he didn't say anything, it was fine

1947
01:52:44.091 --> 01:52:46.217
when I got that through my head,

1948
01:52:46.218 --> 01:52:48.595
I felt less neglected.

1949
01:52:48.637 --> 01:52:52.516
Good. More, more.
He is dying. Dying.

1950
01:52:53.809 --> 01:52:56.811
He had confidence in him, I felt that
he knew what he was doing,

1951
01:52:56.812 --> 01:53:00.649
he had taste, his story
sense was quite good.

1952
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.526
He's the guy who prepped things to death.

1953
01:53:03.527 --> 01:53:05.236
You try to deal with as many variables

1954
01:53:05.237 --> 01:53:07.321
as possible during the
pre-production process

1955
01:53:07.322 --> 01:53:10.409
so that when you're in production,
things hopefully run smoothly.

1956
01:53:10.826 --> 01:53:13.870
So much so that you can
have these happy accidents.

1957
01:53:14.913 --> 01:53:17.373
Filmmaking is really, a lot of it
is just dealing with problems

1958
01:53:17.374 --> 01:53:19.376
all day long, it's story,

1959
01:53:20.419 --> 01:53:22.586
it's story, it's always story,

1960
01:53:22.587 --> 01:53:24.631
first and foremost.

1961
01:53:24.673 --> 01:53:26.633
You saved the ship.

1962
01:53:26.675 --> 01:53:28.677
You saved us all.

1963
01:53:28.719 --> 01:53:30.721
Don't you remember?

1964
01:53:36.018 --> 01:53:37.477
The really, really

1965
01:53:37.602 --> 01:53:40.938
renegade, seat of your pants
crazy comedy of the '70s

1966
01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:45.819
found its way into like a big
mainstream sci fi spielbergian thing.

1967
01:53:45.861 --> 01:53:47.863
Ready?

1968
01:53:51.283 --> 01:53:53.660
Ghostbusters

1969
01:53:53.744 --> 01:53:54.661
you've got this

1970
01:53:54.662 --> 01:53:57.705
sort of rag tag New York story,
but then into it,

1971
01:53:57.706 --> 01:54:01.251
you have this extremely sci fi, techy,

1972
01:54:01.335 --> 01:54:04.795
supernatural, insane thing, and it worked.

1973
01:54:04.796 --> 01:54:06.798
Get her!

1974
01:54:09.926 --> 01:54:11.928
Action!

1975
01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:15.474
I just worked with bill Murray on
stripes, and Harold as well.

1976
01:54:15.557 --> 01:54:17.893
And that turned out well.

1977
01:54:17.934 --> 01:54:18.393
That's the fact, Jack!

1978
01:54:18.435 --> 01:54:21.897
My agent, Michael ovitz,
at that time, sent me

1979
01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:26.068
this sort of 80 page treatment
that Dan aykroyd had written.

1980
01:54:26.735 --> 01:54:29.863
He had written it originally for
belushi and himself.

1981
01:54:30.822 --> 01:54:33.241
I think he had spoken to
Eddie Murphy at some time

1982
01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:36.370
about doing with him.

1983
01:54:36.411 --> 01:54:38.372
It was set in the future,
there were multiple

1984
01:54:38.413 --> 01:54:42.000
ghost busting groups on various plantes.

1985
01:54:42.042 --> 01:54:44.044
And the competed with each other.

1986
01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:48.048
These groups, they worked like firemen.
Their service was to rid the universe

1987
01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:50.092
of ghosts or monsters.

1988
01:54:50.509 --> 01:54:51.468
I said, "look,

1989
01:54:51.469 --> 01:54:55.514
it has this great idea in it,
but it's almost impossible to make.

1990
01:54:55.931 --> 01:54:58.057
I think it should happen today

1991
01:54:58.058 --> 01:55:01.311
and I think it should happen in a
big city like New York.“

1992
01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:04.855
I really pitched
the story of ghostbusters.

1993
01:55:04.856 --> 01:55:06.858
Our courteous and efficient
staff is on call

1994
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:10.404
24 hours a day to serve all
your supernatural elimination needs.

1995
01:55:10.445 --> 01:55:11.738
We're ready to believe you!

1996
01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:17.911
When the actors are really in their finest,
most involved way on the set, in costume,

1997
01:55:18.286 --> 01:55:22.415
they can be the most creative
as well to find some unique way

1998
01:55:22.416 --> 01:55:25.001
of maybe finding a fresh spin on it.

1999
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:30.131
It's directed and free at
the same time, and there was

2000
01:55:30.132 --> 01:55:32.174
I could by just using as few words

2001
01:55:32.175 --> 01:55:36.303
as possible, interrupt the
improvization and refocus things

2002
01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:41.143
so that the storytelling made sense
in the context of everything else

2003
01:55:41.268 --> 01:55:46.313
in terms of character
and in terms of intent and tone.

2004
01:55:46.314 --> 01:55:48.692
And so that things weren't just silly.

2005
01:55:49.025 --> 01:55:51.027
There is no Dana, only 2qu!

2006
01:55:52.946 --> 01:55:54.948
What a lovely singing
voice you must have.

2007
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:56.740
And just look for comedy

2008
01:55:56.741 --> 01:55:59.119
in the reality of the situation.

2009
01:55:59.161 --> 01:56:01.163
We came, we saw,
we kicked its ass!

2010
01:56:02.539 --> 01:56:05.500
It really boils down to the
ghostbusters themselves,

2011
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:07.878
it's charming

2012
01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:10.337
when Dan aykroyd slides down

2013
01:56:10.338 --> 01:56:13.467
that fire pole, when they first go
see this dilapidated firehouse.

2014
01:56:13.508 --> 01:56:15.469
Wow! This place is great!

2015
01:56:16.136 --> 01:56:18.054
They're all big kids.

2016
01:56:18.096 --> 01:56:21.475
We should stay here, tonight! Sleep
here. You know, to try it out.

2017
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.645
It's so crazy and wonderful,
and they're having such a blast

2018
01:56:26.104 --> 01:56:30.066
and that just spills right over to us.

2019
01:56:30.942 --> 01:56:33.320
It's the perfect bill Murray movie

2020
01:56:33.487 --> 01:56:37.531
that laid back goofiness
that only bill Murray has.

2021
01:56:37.532 --> 01:56:40.535
I'll take miss Barrett back to her
apartment and check her out.

2022
01:56:40.869 --> 01:56:42.871
I'll go check out miss
Barrett's apartment.

2023
01:56:42.954 --> 01:56:43.872
The addition of Ernie,

2024
01:56:43.873 --> 01:56:46.415
I think, was really special
in a lot of ways.

2025
01:56:46.416 --> 01:56:50.420
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'll believe anything you say.

2026
01:56:50.462 --> 01:56:52.796
Ernie brought in the
outsiders to people

2027
01:56:52.797 --> 01:56:55.550
that didn't really feel
like a ghostbuster, you know?

2028
01:56:55.592 --> 01:56:59.970
It would be a twinkie... 35 feet long
weighing approximately 600 pounds

2029
01:56:59.971 --> 01:57:01.598
that's a big twinkie.

2030
01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:02.974
I think I was very fortunate

2031
01:57:03.016 --> 01:57:06.019
to be making popular movies

2032
01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:12.566
in this era, an era of directorial power
which we didn't really quite

2033
01:57:12.567 --> 01:57:16.320
have as directors prior to it
and certainly

2034
01:57:16.321 --> 01:57:17.405
after it.

2035
01:57:17.447 --> 01:57:19.449
It's the stay puft marshmallow man.

2036
01:57:20.242 --> 01:57:21.117
My films,

2037
01:57:21.118 --> 01:57:25.580
they almost uniquely have a kind
of emotionality that made you feel good.

2038
01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:29.124
It's the positiveness that made for repeat

2039
01:57:29.125 --> 01:57:29.960
viewing.

2040
01:57:30.001 --> 01:57:32.963
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

2041
01:57:46.142 --> 01:57:48.144
The last starfighter

2042
01:57:48.186 --> 01:57:50.354
the last starfighter is about a boy

2043
01:57:50.355 --> 01:57:53.358
in a trailer park who is
really good at a video game.

2044
01:57:55.068 --> 01:57:57.070
Yeah!

2045
01:57:58.321 --> 01:57:59.655
It turns out to be an

2046
01:57:59.656 --> 01:58:02.075
actual recruitment tool.

2047
01:58:02.117 --> 01:58:04.119
Aha! A test sent out across the universe

2048
01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.621
to find those with the gift
to be starfighters.

2049
01:58:06.788 --> 01:58:08.455
It's the perfect fantasy

2050
01:58:08.456 --> 01:58:11.167
if you play video games.

2051
01:58:11.626 --> 01:58:14.211
It was a genius idea,
the fact that nobody came up with it

2052
01:58:14.212 --> 01:58:17.632
before that, is kind of amazing.

2053
01:58:17.674 --> 01:58:19.634
You were recruited by the star league
to defend -

2054
01:58:20.176 --> 01:58:23.179
to defend the frontier against xur
and the ko-Dan armada.

2055
01:58:23.722 --> 01:58:26.683
Although most of it
takes place in outer space,

2056
01:58:26.725 --> 01:58:29.769
there's such a down to earth
element about it.

2057
01:58:31.438 --> 01:58:33.772
Nick castle, the director,
wanted to imbue it

2058
01:58:33.773 --> 01:58:36.109
with a sort of a capras esque
sort of quality.

2059
01:58:36.318 --> 01:58:38.152
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy

2060
01:58:38.153 --> 01:58:41.156
little town off my feet and
I'm gonna see the world!

2061
01:58:41.197 --> 01:58:43.199
Forget it, man. I'm doing
something with my life.

2062
01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.784
He has this girlfriend,

2063
01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:50.581
he has dreams of doing bigger
things and all his dreams

2064
01:58:50.582 --> 01:58:53.335
keep falling through.

2065
01:58:53.376 --> 01:58:55.378
Still go to city college
with your friends.

2066
01:58:57.422 --> 01:59:01.300
Until this incredible
situation comes along,

2067
01:59:01.301 --> 01:59:03.803
and he almost doesn't
take advantage of it.

2068
01:59:03.845 --> 01:59:07.098
Listen, centauri. I'm not any of those
guys, I'm a kid from a trailer park.

2069
01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:09.260
That's what you think!
Then that's all you'll ever be.

2070
01:59:10.477 --> 01:59:11.269
Robert Preston,

2071
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:13.647
the music man,
the music man in outer space.

2072
01:59:13.688 --> 01:59:15.649
Trouble with a capital t,
and that rhymes with p,

2073
01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:17.150
and that stands for poor.

2074
01:59:17.192 --> 01:59:19.861
When we found out that he would
do it, we were just so happy.

2075
01:59:21.029 --> 01:59:23.031
Centauri!

2076
01:59:23.281 --> 01:59:26.367
Very robust fellow.
Smoke like a chimney,

2077
01:59:26.368 --> 01:59:29.745
but he had that great voice.

2078
01:59:29.746 --> 01:59:31.748
Say hello to my assistant, beta.

2079
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:33.791
Howdy.

2080
01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:37.420
I did get to act with two Alex's lucky me.

2081
01:59:37.462 --> 01:59:39.923
I'm a state of the art,
top of the line beta unit,

2082
01:59:39.964 --> 01:59:42.967
put here as a courtesy replacement
for while you are away.

2083
01:59:45.387 --> 01:59:46.845
He's just comically inept.

2084
01:59:46.846 --> 01:59:48.931
That's why it was fun to play,
because you can

2085
01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:52.352
just put yourself in that position
where everything is brand new.

2086
01:59:52.686 --> 01:59:54.854
Nothing is normal.

2087
01:59:54.896 --> 01:59:57.857
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

2088
01:59:59.317 --> 02:00:02.028
Dan o'herlihy.

2089
02:00:02.112 --> 02:00:03.737
He agreed to play Greg.

2090
02:00:03.738 --> 02:00:06.324
Greg, the gung-ho iguana.

2091
02:00:07.242 --> 02:00:09.785
He would never be seen.
There would always be

2092
02:00:09.786 --> 02:00:12.706
this prosthetic giant mask over him.

2093
02:00:12.872 --> 02:00:16.292
He had to triple what he would
normally do in terms of gestures.

2094
02:00:17.919 --> 02:00:20.213
Ah, now you look cute!

2095
02:00:20.296 --> 02:00:22.005
I never saw him

2096
02:00:22.006 --> 02:00:25.134
not looking like lizard man,
and he's very distinguished looking,

2097
02:00:25.135 --> 02:00:28.430
you know, white haired, blue eyed
Irish guy, you know, and I just didn't

2098
02:00:28.930 --> 02:00:31.057
I didn't really know
what he looked like.

2099
02:00:31.099 --> 02:00:32.726
How do you do?

2100
02:00:32.767 --> 02:00:34.394
He does this like...

2101
02:00:42.444 --> 02:00:44.195
I was cast in last starfighter

2102
02:00:44.237 --> 02:00:48.074
playing a role called Lewis's friend.

2103
02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:51.244
Spaceship lands to return
Alex to the trailer park

2104
02:00:51.494 --> 02:00:54.164
and I go, "aliens, awesome!"

2105
02:00:54.205 --> 02:00:56.124
Oh my god!

2106
02:00:56.166 --> 02:00:58.566
They cut that scene from the movie
before it was ever filmed,

2107
02:00:58.835 --> 02:01:02.171
but I had already done a bunch of
featured extra work, so every year

2108
02:01:02.172 --> 02:01:06.550
I get a couple of hundred bucks from
the last starfighter as a residual payment

2109
02:01:06.551 --> 02:01:10.597
and I get to be part of a movie that,
as a fan, I was crazy about as a kid.

2110
02:01:10.638 --> 02:01:11.973
Are you kidding me?

2111
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:15.517
I was not aware

2112
02:01:15.518 --> 02:01:18.605
of the amount of pressure
because of the cgi,

2113
02:01:19.314 --> 02:01:23.359
the tension it was surrounding,
oh my god, is this going to work or not?

2114
02:01:23.401 --> 02:01:25.528
This may be a colossal failure.

2115
02:01:29.616 --> 02:01:32.327
The very end of the death
blossom sequence,

2116
02:01:32.619 --> 02:01:35.497
when I sat in a cage,
it was like a carnival ride.

2117
02:01:36.289 --> 02:01:39.000
And I could do about two
of them and then I was like...

2118
02:01:44.297 --> 02:01:46.089
The movie didn't make any
money when it came out,

2119
02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:49.636
it was only the people that
saw it on vhs or hbo.

2120
02:01:50.678 --> 02:01:55.016
Someone told me that last starfighter
was number one in video rentals.

2121
02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:58.435
Thank god for science,
creating another Avenue for people

2122
02:01:58.436 --> 02:02:01.272
to see it and enjoy it.

2123
02:02:02.524 --> 02:02:04.107
That's what the movie's about,

2124
02:02:04.108 --> 02:02:07.487
the possibilities are unknown,

2125
02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:12.408
but are out there,
and all you have to do is find them

2126
02:02:12.617 --> 02:02:15.578
and then hold on tight
and go for the ride.

2127
02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.622
Wow!

2128
02:02:26.756 --> 02:02:27.549
No words,

2129
02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:29.717
really, for what buckaroo banzai is.

2130
02:02:29.759 --> 02:02:31.427
Let's rock and roll!

2131
02:02:31.469 --> 02:02:33.595
Could I really tell you the storyline?

2132
02:02:33.596 --> 02:02:35.473
I'm not sure.

2133
02:02:39.143 --> 02:02:41.145
Buckaroo banzai, perhaps
you can explain yourself?

2134
02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:44.147
Do you have to know
what the film is about,

2135
02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:46.317
even if you starred in it?

2136
02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:55.577
Buckaroo banzai is a film

2137
02:02:56.327 --> 02:03:00.832
that to this day, I do not understand.
If you can tell me what it's about,

2138
02:03:01.374 --> 02:03:02.499
I'll give you money.

2139
02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.418
He was able to do everything.

2140
02:03:04.419 --> 02:03:08.755
He was like a scientist,
a rock star, a samurai warrior.

2141
02:03:08.756 --> 02:03:10.632
No limitations whatsoever.

2142
02:03:10.633 --> 02:03:15.305
Just a fun imaginary story
about a group of scientists

2143
02:03:15.471 --> 02:03:20.393
that play rock and roll and,
you know, defy the laws of physics.

2144
02:03:23.271 --> 02:03:25.772
Is it a comedy, is it sci fi,
is it action?

2145
02:03:25.773 --> 02:03:28.276
Is it a social satire?

2146
02:03:28.318 --> 02:03:30.360
Is it a love story? Is it romance?

2147
02:03:30.361 --> 02:03:32.738
What is it?
And it doesn't spoon feed you anything.

2148
02:03:32.739 --> 02:03:36.993
It just throws you in the middle
of this haywire crazy world.

2149
02:03:37.285 --> 02:03:40.245
It was a shipn that was
being steered by Richter.

2150
02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:44.584
Richter and Mac would always
powwow. To them,

2151
02:03:44.792 --> 02:03:46.376
it made sense.

2152
02:03:46.377 --> 02:03:48.880
Subcutaneous microphones
are gonna allow the

2153
02:03:49.005 --> 02:03:51.150
patient to transmit verbal
instructions to his own brain.

2154
02:03:51.174 --> 02:03:52.841
All we had to know

2155
02:03:52.842 --> 02:03:56.012
is that we had to act like
it made sense to us,

2156
02:03:56.721 --> 02:03:57.889
right?

2157
02:03:57.931 --> 02:03:59.599
What are they?

2158
02:03:59.641 --> 02:04:01.869
Lectroids from planet 10 by way
of the the eighth dimension.

2159
02:04:01.893 --> 02:04:02.310
I guess

2160
02:04:02.311 --> 02:04:05.313
I'm going to be the dry, straight
man surrounded by lunatics.

2161
02:04:06.230 --> 02:04:10.777
I had great fun watching Peter
go through his process and Alan go through

2162
02:04:10.818 --> 02:04:13.820
hers and Jeff goldblum just brilliantly

2163
02:04:13.821 --> 02:04:17.784
stealing every scene that he was in.

2164
02:04:19.994 --> 02:04:22.497
We all gave up to Jeff's antics
and just enjoyed them

2165
02:04:22.872 --> 02:04:25.517
rather than try to compete with them
because you couldn't, you couldn't win.

2166
02:04:25.541 --> 02:04:28.419
You know, I thought you were
gonna rehearse or something.

2167
02:04:28.544 --> 02:04:31.005
The Hong Kong cavaliers.

2168
02:04:31.172 --> 02:04:34.509
Billy Vera and the beaters were
kind of the musical center of that show.

2169
02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:36.928
That was really the Hong
Kong cavalier band.

2170
02:04:38.721 --> 02:04:41.975
Peter brought in the clarinet
because he could play.

2171
02:04:42.058 --> 02:04:44.310
It works perfectly.

2172
02:04:45.436 --> 02:04:47.855
Jeff goldblum and I got a
band together after that.

2173
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:51.234
Matter of fact I've got to leave right
here and go play the trumpet.

2174
02:04:51.275 --> 02:04:53.277
Evil! Pure and simple from
the eighth dimension!

2175
02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:56.905
I had special abilities
to do stunts and things,

2176
02:04:56.906 --> 02:04:59.367
and so they asked me
if I wanted to be a lectroid.

2177
02:04:59.409 --> 02:05:01.369
John whorfin destroyed.

2178
02:05:01.995 --> 02:05:04.621
John lithgow is also an intense actor,

2179
02:05:04.622 --> 02:05:07.333
but he's also very silly.

2180
02:05:07.375 --> 02:05:08.209
Of course it's me, you fool.
Who'd you think?

2181
02:05:08.251 --> 02:05:11.546
I think he found lizardo
to be liberating,

2182
02:05:11.587 --> 02:05:16.634
given the gravity that had been
laid on him as an Oscar nominee.

2183
02:05:16.676 --> 02:05:18.678
John lithgow, in the world
according to garp.

2184
02:05:21.389 --> 02:05:23.433
He was just having a good time.

2185
02:05:23.474 --> 02:05:25.267
Where are we going?

2186
02:05:25.268 --> 02:05:26.853
Planet 10!

2187
02:05:26.894 --> 02:05:27.562
When?

2188
02:05:27.603 --> 02:05:28.146
Real soon!

2189
02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:30.481
You put John lithgow and
Christopher Lloyd in a room,

2190
02:05:30.857 --> 02:05:34.110
the mind can't conceive of what
the acting result would be

2191
02:05:34.277 --> 02:05:37.947
I was supposed to be tortured and all I'm
doing is hysterically laughing.

2192
02:05:38.072 --> 02:05:40.198
I think of that scene now I crack up.

2193
02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:42.076
Those are two gifted human beings.

2194
02:05:42.118 --> 02:05:44.078
Bigboote'.

2195
02:05:44.912 --> 02:05:46.914
Activate your probes.

2196
02:05:48.124 --> 02:05:51.169
And then they promise you a
sequel, and the sequel never comes.

2197
02:05:51.502 --> 02:05:55.923
A lot of the studio bosses
didn't know what to make of it.

2198
02:05:56.174 --> 02:06:00.927
It was supposed to be a series of movies
and they were supposed to all

2199
02:06:00.928 --> 02:06:04.640
be as lighthearted
and antic and sort of over-the-top.

2200
02:06:06.684 --> 02:06:08.978
It would fit in so well right now,

2201
02:06:09.103 --> 02:06:11.898
that sort of alternative universe world

2202
02:06:12.356 --> 02:06:15.609
audiences now are more attuned, I think.

2203
02:06:15.610 --> 02:06:19.030
It would have been fun to see it
go on and get weirder and weirder.

2204
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:23.033
My eight year old watched it,
I said, "what's it about?"

2205
02:06:23.034 --> 02:06:24.701
He says, "who cares what it's about?“

2206
02:06:24.702 --> 02:06:27.997
we don't have to care what
it's about, do we?

2207
02:06:29.665 --> 02:06:31.584
I guess not.

2208
02:06:31.626 --> 02:06:33.628
Remember, no matter
where you go,

2209
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:36.631
there you are.

2210
02:06:42.595 --> 02:06:45.431
Terminator is a classic.

2211
02:06:47.517 --> 02:06:49.519
The Terminator

2212
02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:52.188
out of the gate, I appreciated
Cameron's filmmaking.

2213
02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:53.897
It was so satisfying.

2214
02:06:53.898 --> 02:06:58.277
You're just watching this extremely
talented filmmaker erupt onto the scene

2215
02:06:58.611 --> 02:07:00.862
and you just go, oh, I'm going
to now see every film

2216
02:07:00.863 --> 02:07:03.032
this person does because
they're obviously really good.

2217
02:07:03.074 --> 02:07:05.075
What day is it? The date!

2218
02:07:05.076 --> 02:07:07.078
12th, may, Thursday.

2219
02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.122
What year?!

2220
02:07:09.622 --> 02:07:12.250
It goes and it's just perfect.

2221
02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:14.252
You can't do that.

2222
02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:16.295
Wrong.

2223
02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:20.132
I was very inspired
by the editing of Terminator,

2224
02:07:20.133 --> 02:07:23.553
the speech of Terminator,
the harshness of Terminator.

2225
02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.810
The script was an excellent
blueprint for the movie.

2226
02:07:31.227 --> 02:07:35.231
It had propulsion, mystery,
annihilation, suspense,

2227
02:07:35.606 --> 02:07:39.277
romance, time travel.

2228
02:07:40.736 --> 02:07:42.530
It was all there.

2229
02:07:44.615 --> 02:07:46.617
Come with me if
you want to live.

2230
02:07:46.659 --> 02:07:49.161
Because the exposition is all on the run

2231
02:07:49.162 --> 02:07:50.955
during a shootout.

2232
02:07:50.997 --> 02:07:52.998
I'm Reese, assigned
to protect you.

2233
02:07:52.999 --> 02:07:53.916
You've been targeted
for termination.

2234
02:07:53.958 --> 02:07:56.877
You're like living and dying in a scene

2235
02:07:56.878 --> 02:07:59.881
and getting the back story.

2236
02:08:00.882 --> 02:08:03.301
It was a dark version of the future.

2237
02:08:03.467 --> 02:08:07.512
I loved the down and dirty
spareness of a b movie

2238
02:08:07.513 --> 02:08:10.683
sort of aspect to it.

2239
02:08:11.976 --> 02:08:12.518
His hope

2240
02:08:12.519 --> 02:08:17.189
was to make a world class genre picture
heavily influenced by George Miller

2241
02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:20.525
other than the fact that he broke
down all barriers and went

2242
02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:21.694
Gonzo.

2243
02:08:24.822 --> 02:08:28.326
Jim had a certain vision
and he was pushing the envelope.

2244
02:08:28.618 --> 02:08:31.244
We weren't Hollywood
redoing the same thing.

2245
02:08:31.245 --> 02:08:34.957
Jim was saying,
"no, no, no, we can go here."

2246
02:08:38.794 --> 02:08:39.337
In between

2247
02:08:39.337 --> 02:08:40.171
all the action pieces,

2248
02:08:40.172 --> 02:08:44.466
there are some genuine high concept ideas
that get discussed about predestination

2249
02:08:44.467 --> 02:08:46.469
and your fate and what role
you play in history.

2250
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:48.971
You're talking about things
that I haven't done yet

2251
02:08:49.013 --> 02:08:51.807
in the past tense.
It's driving me crazy.

2252
02:08:51.933 --> 02:08:53.141
Computers, once

2253
02:08:53.142 --> 02:08:56.646
they become sentient,
artificial intelligence will turn on us.

2254
02:08:56.979 --> 02:09:00.815
The technology itself will be
bent back upon us in the guise

2255
02:09:00.816 --> 02:09:04.111
of Arnold Schwarzenegger with an uzi.

2256
02:09:06.072 --> 02:09:07.698
Lance henriksen was

2257
02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:11.451
who Jim originally did his concept
sketch of the Terminator around.

2258
02:09:11.452 --> 02:09:14.705
With his skin coming away and
seeing the skeleton underneath.

2259
02:09:14.956 --> 02:09:18.541
I'm sure Lance was very disappointed
when he didn't get to play the Terminator,

2260
02:09:18.542 --> 02:09:21.712
but I can't imagine that
character without Arnold

2261
02:09:21.754 --> 02:09:23.297
portraying it.

2262
02:09:23.339 --> 02:09:25.299
Get out.

2263
02:09:26.884 --> 02:09:29.261
The Terminator skull itself,

2264
02:09:29.262 --> 02:09:33.139
many people don't know this,
the dimensions of it were arrived

2265
02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:37.686
at by taking a life cast of Arnold
and then carving down

2266
02:09:37.687 --> 02:09:41.565
from his features
down to a skull that would fit.

2267
02:09:41.857 --> 02:09:43.900
And those are Arnold's teeth.

2268
02:09:43.901 --> 02:09:46.153
The Terminator has Arnold
Schwarzenegger's teeth.

2269
02:09:46.696 --> 02:09:48.948
The point for Cameron was Sarah Connor.

2270
02:09:49.323 --> 02:09:53.369
He wanted the target to be the
most ordinary person he can imagine.

2271
02:09:53.494 --> 02:09:55.328
It's almost a hitchcockian rule.

2272
02:09:55.329 --> 02:09:56.579
The ordinary person.

2273
02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.039
With extraordinary circumstances.

2274
02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.708
That's what makes you relate.

2275
02:09:59.709 --> 02:10:03.461
Sarah Connor is an ordinary waitress
who will give birth to the savior

2276
02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:04.088
of the future.

2277
02:10:04.130 --> 02:10:07.091
I didn't ask for this honor,
and I don't want it!

2278
02:10:07.133 --> 02:10:08.592
Any of it!

2279
02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:11.595
Linda Hamilton and Michael biehn's
performance was incredible.

2280
02:10:12.179 --> 02:10:16.934
By the time the two of them got together
at the end, they so deserved it.

2281
02:10:16.976 --> 02:10:20.854
You knew exactly why
they were making love, obviously,

2282
02:10:20.855 --> 02:10:23.691
to save the world, to have this child.

2283
02:10:23.733 --> 02:10:25.693
I came across time
for you, Sarah.

2284
02:10:26.027 --> 02:10:28.029
I love you.

2285
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.655
I always have.

2286
02:10:29.697 --> 02:10:31.781
She may be able to change the timeline

2287
02:10:31.782 --> 02:10:34.201
that she's on, is our future determined?

2288
02:10:34.952 --> 02:10:38.581
Do we have a choice in this algorithm
that we find ourselves in?

2289
02:10:38.998 --> 02:10:40.540
There is an ethical dilemma here.

2290
02:10:40.541 --> 02:10:42.793
We have to ask ourselves,
why are the terminators

2291
02:10:42.835 --> 02:10:44.336
trying to get rid of the humans?

2292
02:10:44.337 --> 02:10:47.214
Are the machines of the future
going to be environmentalists?

2293
02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:50.759
Because if they are, we better
be very frightened because we're

2294
02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.388
not doing the job that we need
to be doing to protect this planet.

2295
02:10:54.722 --> 02:10:57.807
And they may see us as a threat
and want to take us out.

2296
02:10:57.808 --> 02:10:59.810
I'll be back.

2297
02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:15.659
2010 is based on Arthur c. Clark's
novel: 2010 odyssey two,

2298
02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:19.872
which is itself a sequel to
the film version of 2001.

2299
02:11:20.748 --> 02:11:23.166
It has the thankless
task of being a sequel

2300
02:11:23.167 --> 02:11:25.628
to the greatest science
fiction film ever made.

2301
02:11:27.004 --> 02:11:29.130
The last thing you want to do
is make the sequel

2302
02:11:29.131 --> 02:11:33.511
to 2001 and piss off
Arthur c. Clark or Stanley kubrick.

2303
02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:37.890
That would not do the film unless kubrick
said okay and Arthur c. Clark said okay.

2304
02:11:37.932 --> 02:11:39.099
And Stanley kubrick, to me,

2305
02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:42.186
is one of the great directors of
the greatest directors that's ever lived.

2306
02:11:42.269 --> 02:11:43.604
I am not.

2307
02:11:43.938 --> 02:11:46.856
The only way to do
it was to make a film that

2308
02:11:46.857 --> 02:11:49.151
honestly could not be compared to 2001.

2309
02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:55.157
They're different in every possible way.

2310
02:11:56.992 --> 02:11:59.369
Kubrick said,
"just make sure it's yours.

2311
02:11:59.370 --> 02:12:00.730
Just make sure you
make your film.“

2312
02:12:02.665 --> 02:12:04.416
Roy scheider plays Heywood Floyd,

2313
02:12:04.417 --> 02:12:07.753
who was originally portrayed
by William Sylvester in 2001.

2314
02:12:08.254 --> 02:12:11.881
He has an opportunity to go out to Jupiter

2315
02:12:11.882 --> 02:12:15.302
and determine what actually happened
with the crew of the discovery.

2316
02:12:15.678 --> 02:12:19.222
Scheider, along with John lithgow
and Bob balaban,

2317
02:12:19.223 --> 02:12:22.601
hitch a ride aboard a Russian
spacecraft captained by Helen mirren.

2318
02:12:22.643 --> 02:12:25.145
What has happened
to American bravery?

2319
02:12:25.146 --> 02:12:27.148
Alive and well,
thank you very much.

2320
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:29.191
What's happened to
Russian common sense?

2321
02:12:30.359 --> 02:12:32.819
This was the height of the Reagan era,
and here's a film

2322
02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:36.866
about Russians and Americans
doing a joint venture in space.

2323
02:12:37.450 --> 02:12:40.619
In Arthur's book, everybody
got along famously.

2324
02:12:40.703 --> 02:12:44.790
I thought it would be interesting
to have all hell break loose on earth

2325
02:12:45.207 --> 02:12:49.170
and have it become serious.

2326
02:12:49.211 --> 02:12:51.212
All American personnel are ordered
to leave Soviet teritorry

2327
02:12:51.213 --> 02:12:53.215
immediately, or they will
be placed under arrest.

2328
02:12:53.299 --> 02:12:54.632
It plays with the cold war

2329
02:12:54.633 --> 02:13:00.013
thing, the early '803 paranoia
that we had, but it also takes hal,

2330
02:13:00.014 --> 02:13:02.850
who is essentially the villain in 2001

2331
02:13:03.225 --> 02:13:06.770
and kind of reprograms him to be the hero.

2332
02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:08.772
Do you want me to stay with you?

2333
02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:12.318
No. It is better for
the mission if you leave.

2334
02:13:13.486 --> 02:13:14.694
Keir dullea returns to

2335
02:13:14.695 --> 02:13:17.406
reprise his role as Dave bowman.

2336
02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:22.995
And Douglas rain
returns to voice hal,

2337
02:13:23.329 --> 02:13:24.121
the computer.

2338
02:13:24.163 --> 02:13:25.748
Talked to Floyd?

2339
02:13:25.789 --> 02:13:26.582
Yes.

2340
02:13:26.624 --> 02:13:28.292
Would you like to
play a game of chess?

2341
02:13:28.334 --> 02:13:29.084
I play very well.

2342
02:13:29.084 --> 02:13:30.084
I'm sure you do.

2343
02:13:30.211 --> 02:13:32.630
I had recorded Douglas first.

2344
02:13:33.005 --> 02:13:36.634
So when keir did his scenes,
he did them with hal.

2345
02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:38.636
I'm afraid.

2346
02:13:38.677 --> 02:13:40.971
Don't be. We'll be together.

2347
02:13:41.013 --> 02:13:43.389
And he came to me aftennards in tears,

2348
02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:48.354
because when he did 2001, he did it
with a cockney third assistant director.

2349
02:13:48.562 --> 02:13:51.022
Open the pod bay doors, hal.

2350
02:13:51.023 --> 02:13:53.234
Sorry, Dave.
Can't do that, Dave.

2351
02:13:53.275 --> 02:13:55.778
We use the docking ring in
leonov to attach to the discovery.

2352
02:13:59.406 --> 02:14:01.575
For a trip back home.

2353
02:14:02.159 --> 02:14:04.452
Roy scheider was joy

2354
02:14:04.453 --> 02:14:06.997
the only quirk with Roy was
he was always in the sun.

2355
02:14:07.248 --> 02:14:10.042
He would be outside the
studio with a reflector.

2356
02:14:10.209 --> 02:14:13.462
The crew put the sign of scheider beach
outside the stage.

2357
02:14:15.089 --> 02:14:19.468
In 2001, the monolith was a sentinel,
it's an alarm that goes off

2358
02:14:19.635 --> 02:14:22.096
that tells some other

2359
02:14:22.555 --> 02:14:25.140
intelligence that somebody
has stepped on the moon.

2360
02:14:25.641 --> 02:14:29.061
I certainly think they left a lot
to people's own interpretation.

2361
02:14:33.607 --> 02:14:34.649
In 2010, the

2362
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:37.403
monolith is a basic life form
building block.

2363
02:14:37.653 --> 02:14:39.655
I think it's kind of futuristic DNA.

2364
02:14:40.155 --> 02:14:42.283
I tried to make a science feasible film.

2365
02:14:42.449 --> 02:14:44.785
I just wanted to make a film
that was completely different,

2366
02:14:45.119 --> 02:14:48.581
so it could not rightfully
be compared to 2001

2367
02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:51.000
because I can't be compared
to Stanley kubrick.

2368
02:14:51.166 --> 02:14:53.252
It's as simple as that.

2369
02:14:53.294 --> 02:14:55.295
What's going to happen?

2370
02:14:55.296 --> 02:14:57.298
Something wonderful.

2371
02:15:04.722 --> 02:15:07.224
Dune, a world beyond
your experience,

2372
02:15:07.266 --> 02:15:09.268
beyond your imagination.

2373
02:15:11.312 --> 02:15:11.937
Dune,

2374
02:15:11.938 --> 02:15:15.940
that's a huge, bestselling book
with a dedicated fan following.

2375
02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:19.820
Back in the '803,
those marketers,

2376
02:15:20.321 --> 02:15:24.742
they had no idea. They couldn't figure
out how to sell the real hard sci fi,

2377
02:15:25.451 --> 02:15:28.620
even though there was huge demand for it.

2378
02:15:28.621 --> 02:15:29.996
People weren't ready for them.

2379
02:15:29.997 --> 02:15:31.789
The precedent hadn't been set.

2380
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:35.753
Dune takes place on four planets,
I could never keep them straight.

2381
02:15:35.794 --> 02:15:37.713
I've had more fun with sand at the beach.

2382
02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:43.259
David lynch's dune,
is this brilliantly evocative story

2383
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:46.221
about 3000 years into the future,

2384
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:49.475
and it's all about the planet dune Iraqis

2385
02:15:50.184 --> 02:15:52.686
the source of spice.

2386
02:15:52.728 --> 02:15:54.688
The spice extends life.

2387
02:15:54.730 --> 02:15:56.732
The spice expands consciousness.

2388
02:15:59.193 --> 02:16:03.739
The metaphor is it's about the middle east
and about discovery of oil

2389
02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:06.469
and how everybody wants
to get their hands on it and occupy it.

2390
02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:08.660
I mean, the drug metaphors
are quite clear.

2391
02:16:08.661 --> 02:16:10.245
You know, throughout.

2392
02:16:10.287 --> 02:16:12.288
Thoughts acquire speed,
the lips acquire stains,

2393
02:16:12.289 --> 02:16:15.584
stains become a warning. It is by
will alone I set my mind in motion.

2394
02:16:17.336 --> 02:16:18.670
But it's this wonderful kind

2395
02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:21.881
of messianic adventure story,

2396
02:16:21.882 --> 02:16:25.302
full of great detail.

2397
02:16:25.344 --> 02:16:28.096
So the design of the
technology, the spacecraft,

2398
02:16:28.097 --> 02:16:32.850
and the hardware is lynchian.
Wonderful sort of gothic sensibility

2399
02:16:32.851 --> 02:16:36.689
or art deco. When you get David lynch
making anything,

2400
02:16:36.814 --> 02:16:40.441
he is fascinated by the textures

2401
02:16:40.734 --> 02:16:43.946
of existence and life.

2402
02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:47.782
The thing that came
in, we were just like, oh lord,

2403
02:16:49.951 --> 02:16:52.329
they were so ugly.

2404
02:16:53.205 --> 02:16:55.289
Who's going to clean up
the messes in science fiction.

2405
02:16:55.290 --> 02:16:58.543
Who's the guy with the mop.

2406
02:16:58.544 --> 02:17:02.047
And of course, we were obsessed with
this idea of what the worms looked like.

2407
02:17:02.339 --> 02:17:06.675
They were the great challenge
of making dune work and very wisely,

2408
02:17:06.677 --> 02:17:11.807
lynch called upon the talents of Carlo
rambaldi, who was the great puppet creator.

2409
02:17:13.267 --> 02:17:16.269
The worms, little...

2410
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:19.440
And then we had t-shirts on the show
that said 'i rode the worm'

2411
02:17:19.857 --> 02:17:21.941
and it was ridiculous, you know?

2412
02:17:21.984 --> 02:17:24.361
I am chani, daughter of liet.

2413
02:17:24.403 --> 02:17:26.405
From my dreams.

2414
02:17:27.781 --> 02:17:28.323
The first day

2415
02:17:28.324 --> 02:17:31.367
of working on dune, I was a little scared.

2416
02:17:31.368 --> 02:17:34.202
That's a huge project.

2417
02:17:34.204 --> 02:17:36.206
I will love you forever.

2418
02:17:36.248 --> 02:17:37.415
You are my life.

2419
02:17:37.458 --> 02:17:40.334
Kyle was a lot of fun,
and he was very diligent.

2420
02:17:40.835 --> 02:17:42.671
He worked hard.

2421
02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:47.133
And he really wanted to do the best job

2422
02:17:47.134 --> 02:17:48.134
he could.

2423
02:17:49.011 --> 02:17:51.013
- The pain!
- Enough!

2424
02:17:51.972 --> 02:17:54.474
Siam felt pretty silly
in that blue thong,

2425
02:17:54.475 --> 02:17:57.644
I got to tell you, he was
kind of like, oh my god.

2426
02:17:59.563 --> 02:18:02.106
I just used to crack up
whenever I saw myself

2427
02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:06.068
on that movie, going, "more deep!"

2428
02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:08.071
More deep!

2429
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:11.617
The stillsuit is built for you.

2430
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:15.037
With a fremen suit
in good working condition,

2431
02:18:15.077 --> 02:18:17.079
life can be sustained for weeks.

2432
02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:19.082
Even in the deep desert, sire.

2433
02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.251
They took about half an hour to get on,

2434
02:18:22.252 --> 02:18:24.128
and then basically we
wouldn't take them off,

2435
02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:26.214
but they'd zip down to here,
but we'd squirm

2436
02:18:26.215 --> 02:18:29.218
out of the top of them
and you'd literally avoid liquids

2437
02:18:30.052 --> 02:18:33.638
so that you wouldn't be the one saying,
I have to go to the bathroom

2438
02:18:33.638 --> 02:18:35.263
and make everybody wait half an hour

2439
02:18:35.264 --> 02:18:38.602
while you go over to where the
bathroom is in churubusco studios.

2440
02:18:39.852 --> 02:18:42.564
Your ears and nose, and
your scalp and your skin

2441
02:18:43.065 --> 02:18:47.527
and your body was just filthy,
so it was quite a commitment

2442
02:18:47.528 --> 02:18:49.862
to clean every night.

2443
02:18:51.365 --> 02:18:54.659
. I think David at a certain
point was like, holy crap,

2444
02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:57.788
this is a big project because he would go,
"well, we'll fix it in post."

2445
02:18:57.913 --> 02:19:00.582
I remember saying, "oh oh“, you know.

2446
02:19:00.624 --> 02:19:02.626
Long live Duke leto!

2447
02:19:05.254 --> 02:19:08.047
After a while, man, it really
just became like

2448
02:19:08.048 --> 02:19:10.717
everybody would get off work
and hit the bar.

2449
02:19:14.346 --> 02:19:16.557
When people saw the movie dune,

2450
02:19:16.974 --> 02:19:19.226
they would be handed a glossary sheet.

2451
02:19:20.519 --> 02:19:23.603
There was a lot of dazzle factor with it,

2452
02:19:23.605 --> 02:19:26.191
but the characters themselves,
it was hard to

2453
02:19:27.234 --> 02:19:29.736
for me anyway, it was hard
to relate to it sometimes.

2454
02:19:29.778 --> 02:19:31.780
I will kill him!

2455
02:19:35.284 --> 02:19:37.285
Paul!

2456
02:19:37.286 --> 02:19:39.745
Why dune didn't didn't land,

2457
02:19:39.745 --> 02:19:44.125
I think, is debatable, but it didn't,
and some people still love that movie

2458
02:19:44.126 --> 02:19:47.462
and some people it never landed
with, no matter how much time passed.

2459
02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:53.260
I think David in a way felt out
of his element. With the other films,

2460
02:19:53.302 --> 02:19:55.469
I think he had much more control.

2461
02:19:55.470 --> 02:19:59.223
The struggle is what's more
common in show business is people

2462
02:19:59.224 --> 02:20:02.226
struggling to get that vision out,
and I don't think he had ever

2463
02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:05.230
experienced that obstacle before.

2464
02:20:10.527 --> 02:20:13.238
Tom Selleck

2465
02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.948
Cynthia rhodes

2466
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:16.991
gene Simmons

2467
02:20:16.992 --> 02:20:18.994
runaway

2468
02:20:19.202 --> 02:20:21.538
runaway was directed
by Michael crichton.

2469
02:20:21.997 --> 02:20:26.418
It is a futuristic cop
movie about robots

2470
02:20:26.585 --> 02:20:28.879
that are programed to kill people.

2471
02:20:35.302 --> 02:20:36.552
I played the bad guy.

2472
02:20:36.553 --> 02:20:38.304
No, really?

2473
02:20:38.305 --> 02:20:40.474
A guy named Luther.

2474
02:20:40.515 --> 02:20:42.517
I said drop your gun.

2475
02:20:44.019 --> 02:20:46.521
I'm not kidding, asshole.

2476
02:20:46.605 --> 02:20:48.649
The way I auditioned is, he said,

2477
02:20:48.982 --> 02:20:53.028
"look into my eyes with intensity
that you're going to kill me."

2478
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:54.153
So I just looked at him.

2479
02:20:54.154 --> 02:20:56.405
He says, "okay, you got the job."

2480
02:20:56.406 --> 02:20:58.699
I never read for the part.

2481
02:20:58.700 --> 02:20:59.785
| just

2482
02:21:00.243 --> 02:21:02.329
did a lot of brooding.

2483
02:21:04.831 --> 02:21:08.377
Kiss meets the phantom of the park.

2484
02:21:11.672 --> 02:21:12.589
Other than that,

2485
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:15.801
runaway was gene's
first villain role, for sure.

2486
02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:18.844
I loved Magnum p.I.

2487
02:21:18.845 --> 02:21:23.350
And I also loved kiss growing up.
Gene and his crazy tongue.

2488
02:21:23.684 --> 02:21:26.268
I remember when I met him
the first time I was like,

2489
02:21:26.269 --> 02:21:29.146
"do you really have a goat's tongue
sewed onto your own?"

2490
02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:32.858
And he'sjust like,
"no, it's just really long.

2491
02:21:32.859 --> 02:21:34.403
The ladies love it, right?"

2492
02:21:36.822 --> 02:21:39.741
Hey, come on, tiger.

2493
02:21:41.243 --> 02:21:43.495
The father-son scenes
with Tom Selleck

2494
02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:45.121
came out real.

2495
02:21:45.122 --> 02:21:47.624
It wouldn't kill you to get
married again, you know.

2496
02:21:47.666 --> 02:21:50.167
I know. It wouldn't kill
you to go to sleep.

2497
02:21:50.168 --> 02:21:54.423
The heart of the story and finding that
underlying humanity and connection

2498
02:21:54.464 --> 02:21:57.134
or relatability to the characters
in these stories.

2499
02:22:01.763 --> 02:22:05.099
Advanced technology
in the movie with my gun,

2500
02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:07.602
which I have in my collection,
I have that original gun,

2501
02:22:08.228 --> 02:22:10.856
you shoot the bullet
and it goes around and finds you.

2502
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:13.608
Heat seeking.

2503
02:22:19.114 --> 02:22:22.367
Little remote control cars.

2504
02:22:25.537 --> 02:22:27.539
One down.

2505
02:22:27.581 --> 02:22:30.000
The spiders that shot acid.

2506
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:35.421
Those were remote control, really neat.

2507
02:22:35.422 --> 02:22:37.423
There was a couple
of different kinds.

2508
02:22:37.424 --> 02:22:38.799
Some would jump.

2509
02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:41.260
Some would scurry.

2510
02:22:41.261 --> 02:22:42.845
I wanted a spider

2511
02:22:42.846 --> 02:22:44.765
so bad.

2512
02:22:44.806 --> 02:22:46.808
Dad, are you coming to get me?

2513
02:22:47.142 --> 02:22:49.561
Kids in dangerous situations, yeah,

2514
02:22:49.811 --> 02:22:52.647
the '803 were a little
more free with that.

2515
02:22:52.689 --> 02:22:55.484
Let him go. Now!

2516
02:22:57.069 --> 02:22:58.402
He's going to let him get killed

2517
02:22:58.403 --> 02:23:03.115
by these crazy acid blowing up spiders.
And it's pretty dark.

2518
02:23:03.116 --> 02:23:06.161
The spiders will let you in,
but they won't let you out.

2519
02:23:06.203 --> 02:23:08.580
I can't have any witnesses,
it's too messy.

2520
02:23:08.705 --> 02:23:11.916
The spiders have been programmed to
kill the first person that comes out

2521
02:23:11.917 --> 02:23:13.542
of the elevator.

2522
02:23:13.543 --> 02:23:16.963
He was just like, "what? Bobby!“

2523
02:23:17.005 --> 02:23:17.172
Bobby!

2524
02:23:17.214 --> 02:23:18.090
I thought it was good.

2525
02:23:18.091 --> 02:23:19.632
I thought it came off well.

2526
02:23:19.633 --> 02:23:21.258
Is the movie a triple a movie?

2527
02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:24.970
No, but my kids saw it
and they gave me a thumbs up.

2528
02:23:24.971 --> 02:23:26.640
That's good enough.

2529
02:23:29.184 --> 02:23:31.561
Ohoh

2530
02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:41.905
Creature effects are a huge part
of the science fiction experience.

2531
02:23:42.239 --> 02:23:45.325
It is so important that we
believe that the creature is real.

2532
02:23:48.703 --> 02:23:51.413
They're really important decisions
for how these films work

2533
02:23:51.414 --> 02:23:54.835
or don't work, if the alien hadn't
worked in alien and aliens,

2534
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.085
they don't work at all.

2535
02:23:56.086 --> 02:23:59.506
And if e.T. Is absurd, then e.T. Fails.

2536
02:23:59.714 --> 02:24:02.801
When you see something on screen,
that you know for a fact

2537
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:05.219
was just a bunch of people pushing
buttons in a dark room somewhere,

2538
02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:06.762
there's a disconnect there.

2539
02:24:06.763 --> 02:24:07.972
But if you see something,

2540
02:24:07.973 --> 02:24:10.975
even if it doesn't look perfectly real,
that's a practical effect.

2541
02:24:10.976 --> 02:24:14.980
You're like, wow! How did they do that?
Where are the operators, what the hell.

2542
02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.399
And so there is a connection there.

2543
02:24:19.192 --> 02:24:22.279
There's a charm,
it's a stylistic approach.

2544
02:24:25.115 --> 02:24:28.451
They were still dynamic enough
when presented the right way

2545
02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:32.079
to immerse you in it, and you
forget all about the technology,

2546
02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.332
which is a good thing,
and you just follow the story.

2547
02:24:34.875 --> 02:24:36.167
I think that was true of Yoda.

2548
02:24:36.168 --> 02:24:37.751
I think that was true of et.

2549
02:24:37.752 --> 02:24:39.086
I saw an early e.T.

2550
02:24:39.087 --> 02:24:42.339
Without the sound effects, and I was like,
"uh, I don't know about this."

2551
02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:45.634
You see it with sound and music and
fine cutting, you don't question

2552
02:24:45.635 --> 02:24:46.635
anything.

2553
02:24:46.636 --> 02:24:48.638
E.t. Found home.

2554
02:24:49.055 --> 02:24:50.973
E.t.'s design was magical,

2555
02:24:50.974 --> 02:24:53.894
in the scenes
that I did with e.T.

2556
02:24:54.186 --> 02:24:57.730
I could suspend my imagination like that.

2557
02:24:57.731 --> 02:25:00.442
It was just like working with another kid.

2558
02:25:02.736 --> 02:25:04.195
When we first saw

2559
02:25:04.196 --> 02:25:07.991
the Yoda stuff and some of
the rushes, it was like,

2560
02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:11.786
I don't know about this puppet.

2561
02:25:12.204 --> 02:25:15.624
And then you see it
cut together in the scene and it's like,

2562
02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:19.794
yeah, totally works.
You buy the intention.

2563
02:25:19.836 --> 02:25:21.837
I'm looking for someone.

2564
02:25:21.838 --> 02:25:23.840
Looking? Found someone you
have I would say.

2565
02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:27.134
The walking Yoda.

2566
02:25:27.135 --> 02:25:31.389
It was a long prospective shot
they wanted, and they were looking for

2567
02:25:31.514 --> 02:25:35.352
a perfectly proportioned guy
that'll fit in the costume.

2568
02:25:35.685 --> 02:25:38.188
They said, "you're too
tall to be Yoda."

2569
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:42.108
So they gave me the knee pads and
you have to learn to walk on the knees.

2570
02:25:42.817 --> 02:25:45.820
I worked with Kenny baker on star wars,

2571
02:25:45.987 --> 02:25:49.449
used to have too many beers at lunchtime.

2572
02:25:50.533 --> 02:25:54.120
Couldn't get in, and Dave
tomlin would go, “get into r2-d2.”

2573
02:25:54.704 --> 02:25:57.624
I said, “but that's not made for me.”
he said,

2574
02:25:58.124 --> 02:25:59.208
“yeah, get in there.”

2575
02:25:59.209 --> 02:26:03.003
Kenny was only three feet,
seven inches tall.

2576
02:26:03.004 --> 02:26:06.799
Man, I'm 4“4. To squeeze
into that was hard.

2577
02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:08.092
It was tough.

2578
02:26:08.093 --> 02:26:12.138
I love that every creature effect
is a team of people working together,

2579
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:17.018
whether it is all of the puppeteers
doing jabba the hutt,

2580
02:26:17.394 --> 02:26:22.274
whether it is one guy
in a suit in predator.

2581
02:26:22.941 --> 02:26:26.528
That giant space worm in the
asteroid in empire strikes back.

2582
02:26:29.322 --> 02:26:33.118
I love that that thing
looks like an oven mitt.

2583
02:26:33.576 --> 02:26:35.828
And it's just someone going like,

2584
02:26:35.829 --> 02:26:38.581
chase it out and do that.

2585
02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:41.209
I'm just certain

2586
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:44.336
slimer is my most lovable,
endearing creation,

2587
02:26:44.337 --> 02:26:47.382
and for those of you that don't
know how he was made,

2588
02:26:48.216 --> 02:26:50.092
I tried to look at it
as a cartoon character.

2589
02:26:50.093 --> 02:26:52.428
You know, slimer was big.
It wasn't actually a puppet.

2590
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:55.598
It was a device that a gentleman
named Mark Wilson wore.

2591
02:26:55.932 --> 02:26:57.182
He looked through the mouth.

2592
02:26:57.183 --> 02:26:58.976
We shot against a black stage.

2593
02:26:58.977 --> 02:27:02.397
I can get people in black suits
as many people around him as possible

2594
02:27:02.772 --> 02:27:06.818
to stick their arms in this puppet
and muscle a smile, even the tongue

2595
02:27:07.319 --> 02:27:10.080
that comes out of his mouth
and licks his lips, that's a tongue glove.

2596
02:27:10.655 --> 02:27:13.032
The whole thing was just to make him
as funny as possible.

2597
02:27:13.033 --> 02:27:15.534
In the movie it works, and I'm really
happy with it, it's the most iconic

2598
02:27:15.535 --> 02:27:16.535
thing I've worked on.

2599
02:27:18.747 --> 02:27:20.581
Everybody knows slimer.

2600
02:27:20.582 --> 02:27:21.333
He slimed me.

2601
02:27:21.374 --> 02:27:24.335
The thing for me has yet to be surpassed

2602
02:27:24.336 --> 02:27:28.256
in the ingenuity and imagination
that you see on screen.

2603
02:27:28.715 --> 02:27:32.885
Rob bottin was the mastermind
behind the majority

2604
02:27:32.886 --> 02:27:36.930
of what you see. At a certain
point during the production,

2605
02:27:36.931 --> 02:27:39.058
Rob was ovennhelmed.

2606
02:27:39.059 --> 02:27:41.769
He was ill and he was not able

2607
02:27:41.770 --> 02:27:45.190
to finish the dog thing effect.

2608
02:27:45.648 --> 02:27:48.359
So Stan Winston decided

2609
02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:51.613
to really make it a very
simple hand puppet.

2610
02:27:51.988 --> 02:27:54.157
You can see if you really look for it,

2611
02:27:54.324 --> 02:27:57.493
the body is where the puppeteers
head is, and the head

2612
02:27:57.494 --> 02:28:01.331
and mouth are simply a hand puppet.

2613
02:28:04.334 --> 02:28:06.336
- Come on.
- Okey dokey

2614
02:28:06.378 --> 02:28:09.130
with Howard the duck, George
wanted to do it as a costume.

2615
02:28:09.172 --> 02:28:12.008
I tried to talk to George out
of it, you know.

2616
02:28:12.092 --> 02:28:15.470
I was like, "you don't know
if it's going to work."

2617
02:28:15.553 --> 02:28:17.137
We don't have the flexibility

2618
02:28:17.138 --> 02:28:20.225
to do what we did today, what we would
be doing with computer graphics.

2619
02:28:20.683 --> 02:28:22.352
But it was going to be a guy in a suit.

2620
02:28:24.354 --> 02:28:25.729
It was a challenge.

2621
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:27.189
My suit was animatronic.

2622
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:30.443
We went through 19
different heads at 50,000 each.

2623
02:28:30.693 --> 02:28:33.321
It was put on, and then
hot glued shut.

2624
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:35.698
So therefore I couldn't
take a regular break.

2625
02:28:36.199 --> 02:28:38.325
No lunch breaks and no breaks at all.

2626
02:28:38.326 --> 02:28:41.287
So they would drop M&M's
down my beak.

2627
02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:42.997
I was a natural.

2628
02:28:42.998 --> 02:28:45.250
I could find my Mark without seeing it.

2629
02:28:46.042 --> 02:28:49.129
If you move shit, tell the duck.

2630
02:28:49.170 --> 02:28:51.673
And I tripped over,
50,000 dollar mask on.

2631
02:28:51.714 --> 02:28:53.954
This is beginning to seriously
undermined my self-esteem.

2632
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:57.261
Predator is the biggest black

2633
02:28:57.262 --> 02:29:00.181
Mark on my career for no
good goddamn reason.

2634
02:29:00.557 --> 02:29:03.643
They handed this design over
that their production designer had done,

2635
02:29:03.685 --> 02:29:05.602
and I immediately said,
"this is never going to work."

2636
02:29:05.603 --> 02:29:08.243
It didn't matter how much time
and money we had, it was impossible.

2637
02:29:08.898 --> 02:29:12.068
They hired Jeanne-Claude
because he's a martial arts expert,

2638
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:14.529
and they put him in the suit
where he can barely totter.

2639
02:29:15.238 --> 02:29:17.907
It was meant to be
replaced and roto'd.

2640
02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:19.992
So of course the guy's like,

2641
02:29:19.993 --> 02:29:22.370
"why? Why did you even hire me?“

2642
02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:26.308
no one had bothered to tell from
production, and he gets there an goes,

2643
02:29:26.332 --> 02:29:27.749
"what's with the suit?"

2644
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:30.031
And I said, "well, you're playing
a monster in this film.“

2645
02:29:30.128 --> 02:29:31.920
“I never thought it was
a real suit."

2646
02:29:31.921 --> 02:29:32.714
"I hate this suit.

2647
02:29:32.715 --> 02:29:35.174
I look like a superhero."

2648
02:29:35.175 --> 02:29:36.800
And then he found out
he was going to be invisible

2649
02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.886
for half the movie,
and he was enraged about that.

2650
02:29:38.887 --> 02:29:40.095
He didn't know
about that, right?

2651
02:29:40.096 --> 02:29:43.975
Don't think these guys read the script?

2652
02:29:44.017 --> 02:29:45.100
I tried and tried to get them

2653
02:29:45.101 --> 02:29:48.688
to let me do something else
that I knew would work.

2654
02:29:49.439 --> 02:29:51.064
And they were like, "absolutely not.“

2655
02:29:51.065 --> 02:29:53.610
it was absolutely doomed
from the beginning.

2656
02:29:54.152 --> 02:29:55.903
They pulled the plug pretty quickly.

2657
02:29:55.904 --> 02:29:57.821
I think it was thanks to Arnold,

2658
02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:01.493
who had formed a relationship
with Stan Winston on the Terminator

2659
02:30:01.743 --> 02:30:04.783
that Stan was approached for the job,
"why don't you call Stan for this one?"

2660
02:30:05.288 --> 02:30:07.289
That's a terrible Arnold impression.

2661
02:30:07.290 --> 02:30:09.209
Knowing they had very little time,

2662
02:30:09.250 --> 02:30:12.794
they decided to take an old school
approach. It's just a man in a suit,

2663
02:30:12.795 --> 02:30:16.549
but it's a man in a suit with a killer

2664
02:30:16.716 --> 02:30:20.261
facial design and a killer finish.

2665
02:30:20.678 --> 02:30:23.973
And one of the great creature
suit performers of all time,

2666
02:30:24.015 --> 02:30:27.435
Kevin Peter hall, who had just done
Harry from Harry and the Hendersons.

2667
02:30:28.561 --> 02:30:31.271
Unlike the alien, the
predator could express

2668
02:30:31.272 --> 02:30:32.941
a little emotion when it looks at you,

2669
02:30:32.982 --> 02:30:36.361
you can almost sense its disapproval.

2670
02:30:40.865 --> 02:30:41.699
Alien,

2671
02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:45.327
one of the most unique
and influential creature

2672
02:30:45.328 --> 02:30:48.372
designs ever. In aliens,

2673
02:30:48.373 --> 02:30:53.126
James Cameron made the wise
decision to really honor

2674
02:30:53.127 --> 02:30:54.753
H.R. giger's designs.

2675
02:30:54.754 --> 02:30:58.549
They removed the clear
skull carapaz thing

2676
02:30:58.550 --> 02:31:01.052
to reveal this sort of bony
under structure.

2677
02:31:02.136 --> 02:31:04.221
It was a combination of men in suits,

2678
02:31:04.222 --> 02:31:06.974
cable actuated puppets.

2679
02:31:06.975 --> 02:31:09.851
And that sort of thing
to bring those alien warriors

2680
02:31:09.852 --> 02:31:10.852
to life.

2681
02:31:14.566 --> 02:31:18.318
You got gymnasts and dancers,
people could really morph

2682
02:31:18.319 --> 02:31:21.364
into these creatures bodies
and bring them to life.

2683
02:31:24.325 --> 02:31:27.704
Occasionally, when you had a break,
you know, you'd see one of these guys with

2684
02:31:27.912 --> 02:31:31.249
with their alien head tucked under
their arm, just smoking a cigaret, right?

2685
02:31:31.916 --> 02:31:35.168
I think it was quite amazing
to see how James Cameron

2686
02:31:35.169 --> 02:31:38.631
and Stan Winston worked
together to create the queen alien.

2687
02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:41.426
It was awe inspiring, really.

2688
02:31:42.594 --> 02:31:43.177
It was like

2689
02:31:43.178 --> 02:31:47.306
watching kabuki theater
Manning Poles that had wires,

2690
02:31:47.307 --> 02:31:50.642
going over pulleys that would work her arm

2691
02:31:50.643 --> 02:31:53.771
or make her walk fon/vard.

2692
02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:00.819
Then in the queen alien head,

2693
02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:06.199
the smallest special effect guy
on the crew, was tucked in her head

2694
02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:10.371
and his only job was to
push goo out of her teeth.

2695
02:32:14.876 --> 02:32:17.003
That was extraordinary filmmaking, man.

2696
02:32:17.629 --> 02:32:21.465
While most of the shots you
see of the alien queen are the full size

2697
02:32:21.466 --> 02:32:24.469
puppet or parts of the full sized puppet,
there are few moments

2698
02:32:24.802 --> 02:32:28.306
where it's actually a
rod puppeted miniature

2699
02:32:28.514 --> 02:32:32.810
built by the skotak brothers
from the Stan Winston studio maquette.

2700
02:32:32.935 --> 02:32:36.021
I mean, that film is the
perfect example of how

2701
02:32:36.022 --> 02:32:38.900
you take every technique

2702
02:32:39.233 --> 02:32:41.944
and you bring it all together,
and that's where magic happens.

2703
02:32:58.002 --> 02:33:00.003
This baby hits 88 miles per hour.

2704
02:33:00.004 --> 02:33:02.006
You're gonna see some
serious shit.

2705
02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:04.967
Back to the future.

2706
02:33:05.009 --> 02:33:06.969
How far you're going?

2707
02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:09.722
About 30 years.

2708
02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:14.267
I love time travel,

2709
02:33:14.268 --> 02:33:17.814
I love the idea that you could just be
transported somewhere in time.

2710
02:33:19.107 --> 02:33:21.150
I'm a huge back to the future fan.

2711
02:33:21.192 --> 02:33:25.613
It's a perfect movie, it's probably one of
the great Hollywood scripts of all time.

2712
02:33:26.072 --> 02:33:28.408
It's just an unbreachable screenplay.

2713
02:33:28.533 --> 02:33:30.910
1955

2714
02:33:32.537 --> 02:33:35.665
you're my mo-you're my mom.

2715
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:36.582
People say to me,

2716
02:33:36.583 --> 02:33:39.585
“what would you say are the most
important aspects of screenwriting?"

2717
02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:43.798
I say, "there's three of them:
Character, character and character."

2718
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:48.219
If you're not with your
characters, you've got nothing.

2719
02:33:49.554 --> 02:33:53.433
When you see doc brown
introduced in back to the future,

2720
02:33:53.516 --> 02:33:57.854
you're going to say, "okay, I will
believe that what he invents works.“

2721
02:33:58.062 --> 02:34:00.939
you look at the delorean
and you say, "yeah, this looks like

2722
02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:03.943
it's something that the guy actually
did build in his garage.“

2723
02:34:03.985 --> 02:34:06.278
I'm from the future.

2724
02:34:06.279 --> 02:34:09.407
I came here in a time machine
that you inveneted.

2725
02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:11.616
Yes, we can have fun with the

2726
02:34:11.617 --> 02:34:15.163
bells and whistles of time travel,
the clock tower, all that stuff.

2727
02:34:15.455 --> 02:34:19.250
But the end of the day, what we
have in back to the future

2728
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:23.962
is a very simple idea,
which is what would happen

2729
02:34:23.963 --> 02:34:27.008
if I was there on my parents' first date.

2730
02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:28.759
We had always wanted Michael j. Fox

2731
02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:33.347
to play Marty mcfly, but we couldn't
get him out of family ties TV series.

2732
02:34:33.973 --> 02:34:36.641
We cast Eric stoltz, particularly

2733
02:34:36.642 --> 02:34:39.770
at the urging of sid sheinberg.

2734
02:34:39.771 --> 02:34:43.816
President of mca. Sheinberg
actually said, "I am so sure

2735
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:47.320
that Eric stoltz is going to be great
in this that if he's not,

2736
02:34:47.737 --> 02:34:50.364
you know, you start the movie
all over again with somebody else."

2737
02:34:50.907 --> 02:34:53.951
Now, he never expected
us to take him up on that.

2738
02:34:55.203 --> 02:34:59.457
Eric didn't have the natural sense
of humor that Michael j. Fox had.

2739
02:34:59.999 --> 02:35:03.169
He kind of played it less for laughs.

2740
02:35:04.629 --> 02:35:08.006
Bob zemeckis gave Eric
the bad news on Thursday night

2741
02:35:08.007 --> 02:35:12.887
and the following Monday or Tuesday night,
we were back at twin pines mall.

2742
02:35:13.012 --> 02:35:14.095
It was the first
time Michael j. Fox

2743
02:35:14.096 --> 02:35:17.141
came to work. Once
he started performing,

2744
02:35:17.225 --> 02:35:21.437
everybody could see this is Marty mcfly.

2745
02:35:21.479 --> 02:35:23.481
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

2746
02:35:24.273 --> 02:35:26.274
out of a delorean?

2747
02:35:26.275 --> 02:35:28.236
The way I see it...

2748
02:35:28.277 --> 02:35:31.072
With the costars,
he brought things out in them,

2749
02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:33.616
and so Christopher Lloyd was better.

2750
02:35:33.658 --> 02:35:35.660
I finally inveneted
something that works!

2751
02:35:36.786 --> 02:35:39.497
Lea Thompson was way better.

2752
02:35:40.289 --> 02:35:42.291
Oh my god, he's a dream.

2753
02:35:42.333 --> 02:35:44.836
Wait a minute, doc, are you trying
to tell me that my mother

2754
02:35:44.877 --> 02:35:46.879
- has got the hots for me?
- Precisely!

2755
02:35:47.296 --> 02:35:50.800
The scene with Marty
and Lorraine in the car

2756
02:35:51.050 --> 02:35:55.471
that was always a
really critical scene

2757
02:35:55.805 --> 02:35:59.016
to be able to pull that off.

2758
02:35:59.058 --> 02:35:59.851
Don't worry.

2759
02:35:59.892 --> 02:36:02.478
If this was going to work,
Lorraine had to break it off.

2760
02:36:02.937 --> 02:36:04.479
We wrote this line,

2761
02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.440
"I feel like I'm kissing..."

2762
02:36:06.482 --> 02:36:07.733
My brother.

2763
02:36:07.775 --> 02:36:09.276
The look on Michael j. Fox's

2764
02:36:09.277 --> 02:36:12.237
face when she pulls away

2765
02:36:12.238 --> 02:36:14.949
after she makes the
move, is priceless.

2766
02:36:15.658 --> 02:36:18.870
It gives us permission to make that work.

2767
02:36:19.078 --> 02:36:21.246
Would it have worked like that with Eric?

2768
02:36:21.247 --> 02:36:24.083
I don't think it had a chance
of working like that.

2769
02:36:25.293 --> 02:36:28.503
This is why actors get the
kind of salaries that they get,

2770
02:36:28.504 --> 02:36:31.549
because when they're
that good, it's worth it.

2771
02:36:32.967 --> 02:36:35.469
This one tells you where you're going.

2772
02:36:35.595 --> 02:36:37.512
This one tells you where you're are.

2773
02:36:37.513 --> 02:36:38.782
This one tells you where you were.

2774
02:36:38.806 --> 02:36:42.226
There are basically two different
kinds of time travel in science fiction.

2775
02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:45.247
There's the ones where you can change
the past and there's ones where you can't.

2776
02:36:45.271 --> 02:36:47.231
Science fiction theater.

2777
02:36:49.066 --> 02:36:52.986
The third kind of time travel is what
I call the back to the future mechanic.

2778
02:36:52.987 --> 02:36:55.591
The picture in back to the future
is the quintessential example of that.

2779
02:36:55.615 --> 02:36:59.076
They establish that as this is the way
things work and they stick to that.

2780
02:36:59.118 --> 02:37:01.078
It's like it has been erased.

2781
02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:03.414
Erased.

2782
02:37:04.874 --> 02:37:05.374
That's the first

2783
02:37:05.416 --> 02:37:08.419
rule of science fiction, you establish
some rules, you stick to those rules.

2784
02:37:08.461 --> 02:37:12.423
It helps, of course,
obviously that it's a comedy.

2785
02:37:12.465 --> 02:37:13.901
We are sending you
back to the future!

2786
02:37:13.925 --> 02:37:16.009
One of the questions ilm had for us

2787
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:18.596
is what is it going to look
like to the time traveler?

2788
02:37:19.055 --> 02:37:22.058
And they were suggesting
all kinds of elaborate effects.

2789
02:37:22.308 --> 02:37:26.187
But at the end of the day, Bob and I said
“time travel should be instantaneous,

2790
02:37:26.312 --> 02:37:29.857
so let's just get on with it."

2791
02:37:34.445 --> 02:37:37.656
Going back to our belief
that what we were telling here

2792
02:37:37.657 --> 02:37:41.744
really was a human story,
it was not a story about technology.

2793
02:37:43.412 --> 02:37:46.998
People say to me,
"why do you think back to the future

2794
02:37:46.999 --> 02:37:50.251
is still as compelling and popular today

2795
02:37:50.252 --> 02:37:52.838
as it was back in the day?"

2796
02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:54.881
Hello? Hello? Anybdoy home?

2797
02:37:54.882 --> 02:37:56.884
- Think, mcfly!
- Think.

2798
02:37:56.968 --> 02:37:58.260
It's all about the characters.

2799
02:37:59.595 --> 02:38:04.058
These are all really
powerful human elements.

2800
02:38:04.308 --> 02:38:07.311
And that is what the movie is about.

2801
02:38:07.353 --> 02:38:11.315
Roads? Where we're
going we don't need roads.

2802
02:38:19.949 --> 02:38:22.952
From the producers of jaws,
and the director of splash,

2803
02:38:23.202 --> 02:38:26.163
cocoon

2804
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:27.248
one of the things I think

2805
02:38:27.249 --> 02:38:31.918
was very evident in the '803,
we saw a lot of young heroes,

2806
02:38:31.919 --> 02:38:35.423
we saw a lot of youth
in this physical prowess.

2807
02:38:36.632 --> 02:38:39.510
What cocoon did, in a
very interesting way

2808
02:38:39.927 --> 02:38:43.346
call into this social standard of

2809
02:38:43.347 --> 02:38:48.560
what old means. A movie like batteries
not included really wouldn't exist

2810
02:38:48.561 --> 02:38:53.566
without the proof of concept
that cocoon was able to supply

2811
02:38:53.607 --> 02:38:55.526
to the industry.

2812
02:38:55.568 --> 02:38:57.069
Everything's happening so fast...

2813
02:38:57.111 --> 02:38:58.194
I absolutely love

2814
02:38:58.195 --> 02:39:01.490
cocoon, beautiful Ron Howard film.

2815
02:39:01.532 --> 02:39:05.744
It's a science fiction film about aliens,
but not really.

2816
02:39:05.745 --> 02:39:08.497
Cocoon is about aging, it's about life.

2817
02:39:08.706 --> 02:39:11.625
Don ameche, Jessica tandy,
hume cronyn, were these

2818
02:39:12.251 --> 02:39:14.502
aging actors.

2819
02:39:14.503 --> 02:39:17.130
Will you still love me when
I can't keep up with you?

2820
02:39:17.131 --> 02:39:19.341
Of course. I love you now
and you can't keep up with me.

2821
02:39:19.425 --> 02:39:22.511
Wilford brimley, who played one
of the older gentlemen in the movie,

2822
02:39:22.636 --> 02:39:26.307
was only 50 years old
during the making of that film.

2823
02:39:28.476 --> 02:39:31.728
They're in this old folks home and doing
what they're doing, every now and again,

2824
02:39:31.729 --> 02:39:34.899
they would go to the swimming pool
and just fool around and have some fun.

2825
02:39:36.901 --> 02:39:39.486
What they don't realize
is that at the bottom of the pool

2826
02:39:39.487 --> 02:39:41.989
are these cocoohs.

2827
02:39:42.031 --> 02:39:44.033
What are rocks doing in a pool?

2828
02:39:44.325 --> 02:39:46.994
These older folks
start to feel rejuvenated.

2829
02:39:47.078 --> 02:39:49.080
They can do things
they couldn't do before.

2830
02:39:49.497 --> 02:39:51.915
You think there's cocaine
in that pool?

2831
02:39:51.916 --> 02:39:53.375
Might be.

2832
02:39:53.417 --> 02:39:55.752
They would do their favorite things,
they would go dancing,

2833
02:39:55.753 --> 02:39:58.714
they would go try to
fix the thing they regretted.

2834
02:39:58.923 --> 02:40:01.425
Some enchanted evening.

2835
02:40:02.009 --> 02:40:03.134
Brian dennehy

2836
02:40:03.135 --> 02:40:08.223
peels back his body suit and reveals
these sort of really magical aliens,

2837
02:40:08.224 --> 02:40:10.810
these sort of glowing beams
that float through the skies.

2838
02:40:14.396 --> 02:40:17.066
These older folks were
offered the opportunity

2839
02:40:17.566 --> 02:40:20.236
to leave earth with these
aliens and live forever.

2840
02:40:20.277 --> 02:40:22.238
Forever?

2841
02:40:22.279 --> 02:40:24.281
We don't know
what forever means.

2842
02:40:24.907 --> 02:40:25.574
The question

2843
02:40:25.616 --> 02:40:29.411
in cocoon becomes,
is this cheating human mortality?

2844
02:40:29.453 --> 02:40:31.580
Is our clock supposed to run out?

2845
02:40:31.622 --> 02:40:33.457
It's a deeply, deeply moving film.

2846
02:40:35.292 --> 02:40:37.461
Can you help me?

2847
02:40:37.545 --> 02:40:39.254
I adored cocoon.

2848
02:40:39.255 --> 02:40:44.718
Ron Howard is able to get to
the heart of the man's struggle

2849
02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:48.347
or the woman's struggle
and be able to overcome it.

2850
02:40:49.974 --> 02:40:53.227
One of the things I love about Ron Howard
is that he is a true storyteller.

2851
02:40:53.686 --> 02:40:57.731
If it's a comedy or a drama
or it's in the future,

2852
02:40:57.898 --> 02:41:01.277
or if it's in the past, or if it's
right here in this very moment.

2853
02:41:01.318 --> 02:41:04.780
The way nature's been treating us,
I don't mind cheating her a little.

2854
02:41:07.116 --> 02:41:11.162
I feel like Ron Howard cares
about how the audience feels

2855
02:41:11.579 --> 02:41:13.581
at the end of the movie.

2856
02:41:23.966 --> 02:41:26.177
We all went to see madmax
beyond thunderdome.

2857
02:41:26.218 --> 02:41:27.343
Huge movie.

2858
02:41:27.344 --> 02:41:32.056
Tina Turner, biggest pop star in the world
at the time, had a hit song on the radio,

2859
02:41:32.057 --> 02:41:34.351
we don't need another hero.

2860
02:41:38.564 --> 02:41:40.148
Thunderdome.

2861
02:41:40.149 --> 02:41:41.149
Sorry.

2862
02:41:41.192 --> 02:41:43.319
I remember the rolling stone cover, too,

2863
02:41:43.819 --> 02:41:47.823
with Mel Gibson and Tina Turner,
and you just went, oh man, this is big.

2864
02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.327
Madmax

2865
02:41:51.368 --> 02:41:53.370
beyond thunderdome

2866
02:41:53.913 --> 02:41:56.123
the post-apocalyptic subgenre.

2867
02:41:56.290 --> 02:41:59.835
It just allowed the filmmakers
imagination to run wild.

2868
02:42:05.257 --> 02:42:07.927
You can feel the ruin of the past

2869
02:42:08.052 --> 02:42:10.763
as they were just trying
to hold on to civilization again.

2870
02:42:11.055 --> 02:42:12.681
And that's what makes it powerful.

2871
02:42:12.723 --> 02:42:14.892
How do we keep living?

2872
02:42:15.184 --> 02:42:18.479
And how does civilization grow again?

2873
02:42:18.938 --> 02:42:20.897
With the road warrior, you're focused

2874
02:42:20.898 --> 02:42:25.236
on gas and misery
and just living day to day.

2875
02:42:25.444 --> 02:42:29.864
The idea develops into
trying to create a new resource

2876
02:42:29.865 --> 02:42:33.284
using methane, to move
toward a new future

2877
02:42:33.285 --> 02:42:35.996
that can be sustainable.

2878
02:42:36.038 --> 02:42:38.039
I don't know anything about methane.

2879
02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:39.333
You can shovel shit, can't you?

2880
02:42:39.375 --> 02:42:41.669
Tina Turner was just so big on screen,

2881
02:42:42.044 --> 02:42:46.048
being a woman of color and just sort of
running that whole situation.

2882
02:42:47.174 --> 02:42:49.926
The master blaster,
you know, their competition

2883
02:42:49.927 --> 02:42:51.552
between each other.

2884
02:42:51.553 --> 02:42:53.555
Who run bartertown?

2885
02:42:53.597 --> 02:42:55.599
Master blaster runs bartertown.

2886
02:42:58.602 --> 02:43:00.186
She tries to force Max

2887
02:43:00.187 --> 02:43:04.316
to do her bidding by killing the blaster
of the master blaster team.

2888
02:43:04.358 --> 02:43:06.318
This is thunderdome.

2889
02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:08.362
Death is listening,

2890
02:43:08.404 --> 02:43:11.490
and will take the
first man that screams.

2891
02:43:11.824 --> 02:43:16.495
We have this big, extravagant,
perfectly insane fight on bungee

2892
02:43:16.578 --> 02:43:20.416
cords inside this thunderdome.

2893
02:43:20.958 --> 02:43:23.877
They had that really menacing
character that he's got to fight.

2894
02:43:23.919 --> 02:43:27.381
And it's this big dude, you think he's
just going to mop the floor with him.

2895
02:43:29.466 --> 02:43:32.176
But then the other thing that was sort of
shocking was when they took

2896
02:43:32.177 --> 02:43:35.389
the helmet off, you've just
sort of felt for the character.

2897
02:43:40.394 --> 02:43:43.938
You saw that he was this
person who was an adult

2898
02:43:43.939 --> 02:43:47.568
that was a child, instantly,
that scene changed for everybody.

2899
02:43:47.776 --> 02:43:50.862
I think that was a magic moment.

2900
02:43:50.863 --> 02:43:54.866
There are two movies in mad Max beyond
thunderdome. There's the first movie, which

2901
02:43:54.867 --> 02:43:59.455
has our hero wandering into part of town
after his rig is stolen from him.

2902
02:43:59.788 --> 02:44:02.875
Then there's this other movie
after he gets kicked out.

2903
02:44:04.877 --> 02:44:07.628
He stumbles across these
sort of like lost children

2904
02:44:07.629 --> 02:44:11.215
in the middle of the desert,
who are apparently the leftover refugees

2905
02:44:11.216 --> 02:44:14.511
from an airliner crash from years
and years and years ago.

2906
02:44:15.220 --> 02:44:18.181
That was too disjointed with the
fact it was two stories,

2907
02:44:18.182 --> 02:44:21.768
whereas with road warrior
and even with mad Max the original,

2908
02:44:21.769 --> 02:44:25.481
there was a direct correlation
from a to z.

2909
02:44:25.814 --> 02:44:26.814
There's...

2910
02:44:27.316 --> 02:44:30.027
A unique challenge in doing sequels.

2911
02:44:30.069 --> 02:44:34.198
There's an audience you're beholden to
and you want to honor that.

2912
02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:38.826
And yet we all feel compelled
to express ourselves uniquely.

2913
02:44:38.827 --> 02:44:40.828
Civilization.

2914
02:44:40.829 --> 02:44:42.831
I'll do anything to protect it.

2915
02:44:43.499 --> 02:44:47.711
We continue this theme
of resource scarcity.

2916
02:44:47.753 --> 02:44:50.714
Don't you understand? This is water.
You can't live without it.

2917
02:44:51.006 --> 02:44:52.548
Madmax beyond thunderdome

2918
02:44:52.549 --> 02:44:56.720
really focuses the futuristic
forecasts and the warning

2919
02:44:56.970 --> 02:44:59.848
that if we don't change,
if we don't alter the way we think

2920
02:44:59.890 --> 02:45:04.477
about how we share resources,
that we'll end up fighting

2921
02:45:04.478 --> 02:45:09.316
over these resources in the future
on a planet that could be a desert.

2922
02:45:09.358 --> 02:45:12.820
This is astickup! Anybody moves,
and they're dead meat!

2923
02:45:20.828 --> 02:45:24.331
Everybody was terrified that
explorers was going to

2924
02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:29.420
was going to be such a big hit that nobody
would think about back to the future.

2925
02:45:32.131 --> 02:45:36.135
The adventure begins
in your own backyard.

2926
02:45:37.136 --> 02:45:40.471
It was supposed to be a Wolfgang petersen
movie for Paramount, and they decided

2927
02:45:40.472 --> 02:45:42.974
they didn't want to make it in Bavaria,
which is what he wanted to do,

2928
02:45:42.975 --> 02:45:47.104
and so they sort of kicked Wolfgang
off the picture and sent me the script.

2929
02:45:49.106 --> 02:45:52.108
I thought it was a terrific script
and really fascinating, particularly

2930
02:45:52.109 --> 02:45:54.570
I just come off of gremlins
and it was very grueling and

2931
02:45:55.195 --> 02:45:58.197
time consuming and difficult,
and here was a movie about three kids

2932
02:45:58.198 --> 02:46:01.033
who built a spaceship and I thought,
this is just like huey, Dewey, and Louie.

2933
02:46:01.034 --> 02:46:01.910
This is like,

2934
02:46:01.952 --> 02:46:06.123
you know, this would be so much fun to do
after this arduous special effects movie.

2935
02:46:06.498 --> 02:46:08.458
Well, not realizing, of course,
that it was...

2936
02:46:08.459 --> 02:46:12.003
Not only was this an arduous
special effects movie, but had children

2937
02:46:12.004 --> 02:46:14.465
in it which can only work
certain hours of the day

2938
02:46:15.007 --> 02:46:16.800
and which also didn't have a third act.

2939
02:46:21.096 --> 02:46:23.098
It's pretty neat, huh?

2940
02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:26.058
Nonetheless, I made the movie,
but then in the middle of making it,

2941
02:46:26.059 --> 02:46:27.477
the studio changed hands

2942
02:46:27.478 --> 02:46:30.480
and the new people decided they w
anted to put it out on unfinished.

2943
02:46:30.481 --> 02:46:32.899
So they said, “stop working on it.
We're gonna put it out because it's last

2944
02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:35.902
year's movie from the old regime and
we don't care if it makes money.

2945
02:46:35.903 --> 02:46:37.070
Anyway, good bye."

2946
02:46:38.363 --> 02:46:40.490
I firmly believe there was a hell of a lot

2947
02:46:40.491 --> 02:46:44.327
better moving in there
than we were allowed to get out.

2948
02:46:44.328 --> 02:46:46.662
In the end, it didn't matter.
We could have released a blank film

2949
02:46:46.663 --> 02:46:48.332
and nobody would have noticed.

2950
02:46:51.168 --> 02:46:54.171
I've always had a knack of
finding kids that I could relate to

2951
02:46:54.463 --> 02:46:56.298
on a personal level.

2952
02:46:57.841 --> 02:47:00.361
If you cast your movie right,
you don't have to do a lot of directing.

2953
02:47:00.385 --> 02:47:01.594
And if you cast your movie wrong,

2954
02:47:01.595 --> 02:47:03.755
you have to do a lot of directing
and a lot of editing.

2955
02:47:04.097 --> 02:47:06.433
But in this case, these kids
were perfect for the part.

2956
02:47:06.475 --> 02:47:07.850
Incredibly talented.

2957
02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:11.396
And this was Ethan's first movie,
he'd never been on the sound stage before.

2958
02:47:16.235 --> 02:47:18.237
I can't stop thinking
about what's up there.

2959
02:47:18.445 --> 02:47:18.987
He picked it up

2960
02:47:18.988 --> 02:47:21.072
so quickly that some of the
camera people said,

2961
02:47:21.073 --> 02:47:22.865
“are you sure this
kid isn't a professional?"

2962
02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:24.243
And now he is.

2963
02:47:24.284 --> 02:47:26.285
Oh my god.

2964
02:47:26.286 --> 02:47:27.704
There she is.

2965
02:47:27.746 --> 02:47:30.331
In the original script,
the kids go to another planet

2966
02:47:30.332 --> 02:47:33.544
and they find kids just like themselves
and they play baseball and they go home.

2967
02:47:34.253 --> 02:47:36.880
And I didn't think that was
enough for a feature film.

2968
02:47:37.381 --> 02:47:41.969
And so we reworked it so that the
aliens are indeed like our kids.

2969
02:47:42.052 --> 02:47:45.721
But they're even more like earth kids
because they're a product

2970
02:47:45.722 --> 02:47:47.933
of listening to earth broadcasts.

2971
02:47:47.975 --> 02:47:49.935
They get TV up here?

2972
02:47:49.977 --> 02:47:52.187
Just waves in space.

2973
02:47:52.312 --> 02:47:55.314
So they speak in catchphrases,
trying to communicate with the earth kids

2974
02:47:55.315 --> 02:47:58.359
by using phrases that
they've heard on commercials,

2975
02:47:58.360 --> 02:47:59.361
on television.

2976
02:47:59.403 --> 02:48:01.697
- Me Ben.
- Me Tarzan.

2977
02:48:04.866 --> 02:48:05.701
This, it turned out,

2978
02:48:05.702 --> 02:48:07.953
was not an especially popular conceit.

2979
02:48:07.995 --> 02:48:09.955
We come in peace.

2980
02:48:10.956 --> 02:48:12.123
When Ethan hawke

2981
02:48:12.124 --> 02:48:16.043
says that he's waited all his life
to speak to aliens and the aliens says,

2982
02:48:16.044 --> 02:48:18.046
Ehhhhhh, what's up doc?

2983
02:48:18.463 --> 02:48:19.839
He gets very confused.

2984
02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:24.594
The audience also got a little confused,
and because he became disappointed

2985
02:48:24.595 --> 02:48:27.680
in what had been promised
as a great big space adventure

2986
02:48:27.681 --> 02:48:29.390
that would give him
the secret of the universe.

2987
02:48:29.391 --> 02:48:33.353
I think they all felt the same way.

2988
02:48:33.395 --> 02:48:35.396
But it don't make any sense.

2989
02:48:35.397 --> 02:48:36.897
That's the way they
think that we talk.

2990
02:48:36.898 --> 02:48:38.399
It didn't help the fact
that it opened on the day

2991
02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:40.600
of the live aid concert where
nobody went to the movies.

2992
02:48:40.902 --> 02:48:44.280
However, the miracle of home video
kind of resurrected it, and even though

2993
02:48:44.281 --> 02:48:46.783
it's only a shadow of the movie
I was intending to make,

2994
02:48:46.867 --> 02:48:49.786
it still has retained its
popularity over the years.

2995
02:48:51.788 --> 02:48:53.790
That was great!

2996
02:48:59.671 --> 02:49:00.838
What would you do

2997
02:49:00.839 --> 02:49:03.425
if you had everything you wanted?

2998
02:49:03.467 --> 02:49:05.176
Universal pictures presents

2999
02:49:05.177 --> 02:49:06.886
a John Hughes film

3000
02:49:06.887 --> 02:49:08.220
weird science

3001
02:49:08.221 --> 02:49:09.389
it's purely sexual

3002
02:49:09.431 --> 02:49:12.391
weird science really resonated with
me because I was an awkward kid

3003
02:49:12.392 --> 02:49:15.729
who loved technology and just to think of,

3004
02:49:16.146 --> 02:49:19.191
I could suddenly become cool.

3005
02:49:19.483 --> 02:49:21.193
It was the teenage Frankenstein.

3006
02:49:25.072 --> 02:49:27.741
So they created this beautiful woman.

3007
02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:35.956
I think that was probably

3008
02:49:35.957 --> 02:49:38.585
every geek's dream.

3009
02:49:38.627 --> 02:49:41.505
What would you little maniacs
likd to do first?

3010
02:49:41.546 --> 02:49:43.798
I think what he was best at,

3011
02:49:43.799 --> 02:49:48.595
John Hughes, is teenage angst and being
left out. His compassion for that.

3012
02:49:48.804 --> 02:49:51.223
It really resonated,
I think, to a lot of people.

3013
02:49:54.059 --> 02:49:56.561
Yo! Check this out!

3014
02:49:56.812 --> 02:49:58.104
Teenage life,

3015
02:49:58.105 --> 02:50:01.525
thank god I'm not there
anymore. Oh, god.

3016
02:50:01.566 --> 02:50:04.027
You made me.

3017
02:50:04.069 --> 02:50:06.071
You control me.

3018
02:50:06.655 --> 02:50:07.738
Kelly lebrock.

3019
02:50:07.739 --> 02:50:11.368
She had a sense of humor and a sexuality

3020
02:50:11.785 --> 02:50:14.788
and a confidence and a personality.

3021
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:16.790
I can be a real serious bitch.

3022
02:50:17.207 --> 02:50:19.960
It was elevated,
her portrayal of the character.

3023
02:50:20.168 --> 02:50:23.088
And it made everything come together

3024
02:50:23.588 --> 02:50:25.882
the way it was supposed to.

3025
02:50:25.924 --> 02:50:27.884
You guys have better loosen up.

3026
02:50:32.055 --> 02:50:32.973
One of the themes is

3027
02:50:32.974 --> 02:50:35.892
be careful what you wish for.

3028
02:50:39.688 --> 02:50:43.191
Using all of our technology
to do something wrong

3029
02:50:43.233 --> 02:50:46.652
and then not being able to control it,
then having the consequences,

3030
02:50:46.653 --> 02:50:47.821
which is me.

3031
02:50:47.863 --> 02:50:50.657
Tossed off into any good
books lately, have we?

3032
02:50:51.575 --> 02:50:54.295
Warner brothers were going to sue
their ass off if I looked like wez.

3033
02:50:55.078 --> 02:50:56.871
And yet they got me to look as close

3034
02:50:56.872 --> 02:50:59.082
like wez as is humanly possible.

3035
02:51:03.587 --> 02:51:07.215
I walked around that set
when I came onto it at universal,

3036
02:51:07.466 --> 02:51:10.009
like a two story house
that could be pulled

3037
02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:13.180
into two halves to film
in a real two story house.

3038
02:51:13.764 --> 02:51:17.057
And when they needed to have
a rocket to go through it,

3039
02:51:17.058 --> 02:51:20.228
they actually had a rocket.

3040
02:51:22.355 --> 02:51:24.816
This actual shell of a rocket

3041
02:51:25.108 --> 02:51:28.612
was built under stage 26 at universal

3042
02:51:28.695 --> 02:51:31.697
to come up hydraulically and Pierce

3043
02:51:31.698 --> 02:51:35.118
the actual floor of the set of the house.

3044
02:51:35.786 --> 02:51:37.870
And it was a one time shot.

3045
02:51:37.871 --> 02:51:42.083
What a big deal this scene,
right when John calls action

3046
02:51:42.459 --> 02:51:46.046
Anthony Michael hall farts
a silent but deadly.

3047
02:51:47.547 --> 02:51:49.340
It had to be a several hundred thousand

3048
02:51:49.341 --> 02:51:53.136
dollar moment that got ruined by a fart.

3049
02:51:53.804 --> 02:51:54.888
That's not cool, man.

3050
02:51:56.515 --> 02:52:00.810
If you watch the movie real closely,
we did this scene again

3051
02:52:00.811 --> 02:52:06.565
and they lowered the rocket and
we had to do all of our action backwards

3052
02:52:06.566 --> 02:52:10.153
and then they ran
it backwards for the final cut.

3053
02:52:17.619 --> 02:52:19.578
It was massive anarchy

3054
02:52:19.579 --> 02:52:23.959
at the end of that movie, that movie truly
is almost like the cat in the hat.

3055
02:52:24.084 --> 02:52:27.629
She is the the cat in the hat.

3056
02:52:30.465 --> 02:52:34.427
Oh, my god, weird science forever to me
is now going to be Dr. Seuss.

3057
02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:36.971
When are you gonna learn
people like you for what you are,

3058
02:52:36.972 --> 02:52:38.974
not for what you can give them.

3059
02:52:39.724 --> 02:52:42.143
The ultimate theme of weird science was

3060
02:52:42.269 --> 02:52:44.855
be yourself and you'll still get the girl.

3061
02:52:44.896 --> 02:52:46.857
I love you!

3062
02:52:47.858 --> 02:52:49.483
It may not be that girl,

3063
02:52:49.484 --> 02:52:51.486
but you'll still get the girl.

3064
02:52:51.528 --> 02:52:54.114
Drop and give me 20.

3065
02:53:04.708 --> 02:53:07.335
I was really excited by the space
shuttle program as a kid

3066
02:53:07.377 --> 02:53:09.671
because it was putting
people back in space.

3067
02:53:09.713 --> 02:53:11.423
The first space shuttle.

3068
02:53:11.464 --> 02:53:13.842
That had it happened
in my lifetime to that point.

3069
02:53:15.677 --> 02:53:20.056
The space shuttle was amazing
because of what promise it held,

3070
02:53:20.348 --> 02:53:23.643
which was we were going to be able to do
this much more often, much more cheaply.

3071
02:53:25.186 --> 02:53:28.481
The fact that they named
the very first space shuttle enterprise

3072
02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:32.276
was really cool and made me feel seen
because I was a Star Trek

3073
02:53:32.277 --> 02:53:36.113
nerd and I was like, wow, they named
real science after a TV show that I like.

3074
02:53:36.114 --> 02:53:38.365
That's really cool.

3075
02:53:38.366 --> 02:53:41.077
The vehicle came around
the corner of the building,

3076
02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:44.331
and in tow was the shuttle craft,

3077
02:53:45.498 --> 02:53:47.626
and across the nose of the shuttle craft

3078
02:53:49.294 --> 02:53:52.713
were the words the enterprise.

3079
02:53:52.714 --> 02:53:53.632
Knocked me out.

3080
02:53:53.633 --> 02:53:59.012
My perspective just totally changed,
and I said, "we are genuinely

3081
02:53:59.137 --> 02:54:02.599
in some small way, a part of history."

3082
02:54:03.725 --> 02:54:07.479
Suddenly, the highest form of
technology in the space program

3083
02:54:07.687 --> 02:54:11.191
became something extremely
familiar to everyday people.

3084
02:54:11.524 --> 02:54:12.983
We're not just in the audience anymore.

3085
02:54:12.984 --> 02:54:16.613
Now we can become a part of the adventure
when it's a space shuttle.

3086
02:54:16.905 --> 02:54:21.034
You start to see these films
like life force and hangar 18,

3087
02:54:21.076 --> 02:54:25.413
and airplane ii, spacecamp, that have at
the center of them, the space shuttle.

3088
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:27.832
Go for main engine test.

3089
02:54:30.752 --> 02:54:34.839
It was this great bridge
between our reality

3090
02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:37.842
and the fantastic imagined world

3091
02:54:37.884 --> 02:54:41.346
of the future.

3092
02:54:44.516 --> 02:54:48.185
It was almost to the point where soon
we're going to be able to get a ticket,

3093
02:54:48.186 --> 02:54:51.147
you know, and take a
flight around the earth.

3094
02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:55.443
I was pretty close with Steven Spielberg,

3095
02:54:55.485 --> 02:54:56.319
and we would both

3096
02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:59.321
talk about wanting to go and wanting to go,
because they were talking about

3097
02:54:59.322 --> 02:55:02.659
taking an artist, taking
a filmmaker, taking a poet.

3098
02:55:02.701 --> 02:55:06.663
I'd like to go out and be behind
the camera, photographing up there.

3099
02:55:08.999 --> 02:55:10.374
Everyone just assumed

3100
02:55:10.375 --> 02:55:14.379
that space travel was so safe, you know?

3101
02:55:14.421 --> 02:55:16.381
Three, two, one... and liftoff!

3102
02:55:18.967 --> 02:55:21.177
I was shooting a TV movie.

3103
02:55:21.594 --> 02:55:24.263
We all gathered around a television screen

3104
02:55:24.264 --> 02:55:27.558
to watch this spectacular event
because we also knew

3105
02:55:27.559 --> 02:55:30.645
that there were civilians aboard,
so it made it extra special.

3106
02:55:32.063 --> 02:55:36.651
I was in New York, editing a video
production, we were interrupted.

3107
02:55:36.693 --> 02:55:38.069
Someone came in and said

3108
02:55:40.447 --> 02:55:44.034
"the challenger has just exploded."

3109
02:55:44.075 --> 02:55:46.635
- Challenger, go at throttle up.
- Challenger, go at throttle up.

3110
02:55:50.749 --> 02:55:53.626
And it just like stuck
a knife in my heart.

3111
02:55:53.668 --> 02:55:55.669
2,900 feet per second,
altitude nine nautical miles,

3112
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:57.672
downrange distance
seven nautical miles.

3113
02:55:59.632 --> 02:56:02.468
We were all standing there
just in shell shock.

3114
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:05.305
It was something...
It was unthinkable.

3115
02:56:06.097 --> 02:56:08.141
Absolutely devastating
in every possible way.

3116
02:56:08.224 --> 02:56:11.019
The first teacher in the teachers
and space program

3117
02:56:11.144 --> 02:56:14.104
was killed, and one of the first
African-American astronauts

3118
02:56:14.105 --> 02:56:16.357
was killed on the challenger explosion.

3119
02:56:17.734 --> 02:56:22.237
That shot of christa mcauliffe's parents
on the beach looking up at that twisted

3120
02:56:22.238 --> 02:56:25.575
contrail, knowing something's wrong
and not knowing quite what it was.

3121
02:56:27.202 --> 02:56:29.411
That image is seared into the minds

3122
02:56:29.412 --> 02:56:32.706
of a lot of people who saw that.

3123
02:56:32.707 --> 02:56:35.293
Today is a day for mourning
and remembering.

3124
02:56:35.543 --> 02:56:38.588
They had a hunger to explore
the universe and discover its truths.

3125
02:56:39.005 --> 02:56:40.631
They served all of us.

3126
02:56:40.632 --> 02:56:44.052
They, the members of the
challenger crew, were pioneers.

3127
02:56:45.762 --> 02:56:47.221
I think it was our first taste

3128
02:56:47.222 --> 02:56:50.767
of the genuine danger of it.

3129
02:56:53.394 --> 02:56:56.313
I just remember being so afraid

3130
02:56:56.314 --> 02:56:59.901
that this was going to be
the end of human space flight.

3131
02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:02.612
They wouldn't have sent a
teacher up, for god's sakes,

3132
02:57:03.029 --> 02:57:06.323
you know, if they knew that there was some

3133
02:57:06.324 --> 02:57:10.286
any chance at all of it being tragic.

3134
02:57:10.328 --> 02:57:11.328
Karen Allen

3135
02:57:11.329 --> 02:57:12.330
Barry bostwick

3136
02:57:12.372 --> 02:57:14.039
you're a wonderful crew.
Fine, that's great!

3137
02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:15.041
Challenger

3138
02:57:15.083 --> 02:57:17.042
we just wanted to honor the memories

3139
02:57:17.043 --> 02:57:21.131
and the talent and the heroism
of those original astronauts.

3140
02:57:21.506 --> 02:57:23.799
It was not only

3141
02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:26.886
the people who were lost, who were killed,

3142
02:57:27.595 --> 02:57:30.515
but it was the program
itself had been damaged.

3143
02:57:31.683 --> 02:57:35.436
The human race's fonnard movement toward

3144
02:57:35.979 --> 02:57:38.480
a future in space

3145
02:57:38.481 --> 02:57:41.526
beyond this planet,
something I had cheered for

3146
02:57:41.943 --> 02:57:45.572
since the time I was a kid.

3147
02:57:45.613 --> 02:57:48.157
The dedication of Star Trek iv

3148
02:57:48.158 --> 02:57:52.662
to the crew of the challenger
was a way of acknowledging

3149
02:57:53.413 --> 02:57:57.083
that there is a question
and a price to be paid

3150
02:57:58.418 --> 02:58:00.878
for going boldly

3151
02:58:00.879 --> 02:58:04.632
where people haven't gone before.

3152
02:58:10.847 --> 02:58:13.807
When the lights dimmed in the theater
and the dedication came on,

3153
02:58:13.808 --> 02:58:17.854
you could hear a pin drop for a
moment and then applause.

3154
02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:21.940
Science fiction fans,
they're much more focused

3155
02:58:21.941 --> 02:58:25.778
on the possibilities than the dangers

3156
02:58:26.321 --> 02:58:29.657
that every mission is life and death.

3157
02:58:30.783 --> 02:58:32.826
And the challenger disaster

3158
02:58:32.827 --> 02:58:36.831
was as if someone dear to me
in my life had died.

3159
02:58:36.998 --> 02:58:39.250
I said, "we've got to come back from this.

3160
02:58:40.293 --> 02:58:42.669
It will not be easy,

3161
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:46.132
but we've got to come back
and we've got to keep going fonnard."

3162
02:58:47.133 --> 02:58:49.594
And thank goodness, that's what we did.

3163
02:59:05.026 --> 02:59:05.902
John badham

3164
02:59:05.903 --> 02:59:09.113
is among the last
of the utilitarian directors.

3165
02:59:09.489 --> 02:59:13.158
He could just direct anything: Action,
comedy, like comedy, romance, you name it

3166
02:59:13.159 --> 02:59:15.411
John badham could do it.
Short circuit,

3167
02:59:15.745 --> 02:59:17.580
it proved this as much as anything else.

3168
02:59:17.622 --> 02:59:19.414
Short circuit

3169
02:59:19.415 --> 02:59:20.833
I am a light.

3170
02:59:21.042 --> 02:59:21.876
Short circuit. I. Am. Alive.

3171
02:59:21.877 --> 02:59:24.545
Only instead of it being
an alien, it's a robot.

3172
02:59:24.587 --> 02:59:26.547
Welcome to my planet!

3173
02:59:27.298 --> 02:59:28.840
And you got Steve guttenberg

3174
02:59:28.841 --> 02:59:32.845
and ally sheedy, and the guy who
was supposed to be an Indian-American

3175
02:59:33.137 --> 02:59:36.099
but is actually being
played by Fisher Stevens.

3176
02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:38.518
It's only being wires and
several mechanisms and other

3177
02:59:38.559 --> 02:59:41.062
such machine-type apparatus,
for the Pete of sake.

3178
02:59:41.521 --> 02:59:45.483
Today, I'm not sure you could
get away with that.

3179
02:59:45.525 --> 02:59:47.485
Where are you from, anyway?

3180
02:59:47.527 --> 02:59:49.529
Bakersfield originally.

3181
02:59:49.570 --> 02:59:51.340
- No, I mean your ancestors.
- Oh, them. Pittsburgh.

3182
02:59:51.364 --> 02:59:53.615
Ally sheedy, as a young girl,

3183
02:59:53.616 --> 02:59:56.119
I looked up to, I loved and adored.

3184
02:59:56.160 --> 02:59:58.161
Malfunction

3185
02:59:58.162 --> 02:59:59.247
oh, you can talk!

3186
02:59:59.289 --> 03:00:02.583
Short circuit is a caretaker
friendship bond.

3187
03:00:02.667 --> 03:00:08.005
This concept of this robot
finding his humanity.

3188
03:00:08.006 --> 03:00:10.382
I need information.
I must learn everything.

3189
03:00:10.383 --> 03:00:12.218
I am alive.

3190
03:00:12.260 --> 03:00:14.262
Holy crow you can read!

3191
03:00:15.722 --> 03:00:17.931
And he has this quirky,

3192
03:00:17.932 --> 03:00:22.686
outgoing, weird personality, much like me,
that was based on all of the movies

3193
03:00:22.687 --> 03:00:25.315
and pop culture that he had picked up.

3194
03:00:25.356 --> 03:00:27.858
Disguise! Camouflage!

3195
03:00:27.859 --> 03:00:29.861
- Hi!
- Number 5!

3196
03:00:29.944 --> 03:00:31.194
There's a sense of joy

3197
03:00:31.195 --> 03:00:34.991
to that movie and a sense of life
and a sense of adventure.

3198
03:00:35.616 --> 03:00:39.495
He's built as a military weapon of war
that can destroy things with like

3199
03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:40.913
a single laser bolt.

3200
03:00:42.332 --> 03:00:45.335
Hello bozos!

3201
03:00:46.711 --> 03:00:47.813
But as a kid, you don't see that.

3202
03:00:47.837 --> 03:00:50.173
You don't think about that,
you're just like, he's alive.

3203
03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:53.967
Johnny 5.

3204
03:00:53.968 --> 03:00:57.971
He's just like, "no, I'm going to
smell flowers and hang out

3205
03:00:57.972 --> 03:01:02.268
and dance or make friends or whatever",
which was really neat premise.

3206
03:01:02.518 --> 03:01:05.687
One of my favorite moments in that movie
is when he accidentally steps

3207
03:01:05.688 --> 03:01:06.814
on a grasshopper.

3208
03:01:06.856 --> 03:01:07.690
Look what you did!

3209
03:01:07.691 --> 03:01:08.691
Error.

3210
03:01:08.733 --> 03:01:10.902
And he has this moment where he realizes

3211
03:01:11.444 --> 03:01:13.154
that he's mortal.

3212
03:01:13.196 --> 03:01:15.197
Disassemble.

3213
03:01:15.198 --> 03:01:17.200
Dead.

3214
03:01:17.241 --> 03:01:19.242
Disassemble!

3215
03:01:19.243 --> 03:01:20.203
Dead!

3216
03:01:20.244 --> 03:01:23.831
Being aware of your own mortality
is one of the deepest, most profoundly

3217
03:01:23.873 --> 03:01:27.919
human things, and that drives us
and that makes us what we are.

3218
03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:31.422
Of course I know it's wrong to kill,
but who told you?

3219
03:01:31.756 --> 03:01:34.759
I told me.

3220
03:01:34.842 --> 03:01:36.927
What short circuit does
really, really well

3221
03:01:36.928 --> 03:01:39.013
it makes you feel for this metal.

3222
03:01:39.472 --> 03:01:40.098
It's got some,

3223
03:01:40.098 --> 03:01:40.348
you know,

3224
03:01:40.349 --> 03:01:43.600
wonky little eyebrows or whatever,
and he's cute in his own sort of way,

3225
03:01:43.601 --> 03:01:45.102
but his metal, right?

3226
03:01:45.103 --> 03:01:48.564
And yet by the end of that movie,
you're like, "no, Johnny 5 is alive.

3227
03:01:48.981 --> 03:01:50.233
You can't disassemble him."

3228
03:01:50.274 --> 03:01:52.275
Don't shoot!

3229
03:01:52.276 --> 03:01:54.278
Don't shoot! He's alive!

3230
03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:55.154
He's alive!

3231
03:01:55.196 --> 03:01:58.032
You feel for it, and it's hard
to know sometimes

3232
03:01:58.366 --> 03:02:00.575
whether that's just
another part of the way

3233
03:02:00.576 --> 03:02:04.121
that humans are hardwired
to sort of anthropomorphize things

3234
03:02:04.122 --> 03:02:06.392
or whether that's a thing
that we're going to have to really sort of

3235
03:02:06.416 --> 03:02:09.001
worry about in the future.

3236
03:02:09.043 --> 03:02:11.044
Maybe Johnny.

3237
03:02:11.045 --> 03:02:14.048
Yeah! Johnny 5. It's cool.

3238
03:02:18.886 --> 03:02:20.512
Alien is one of the
most frightening movies

3239
03:02:20.513 --> 03:02:22.014
I've ever seen.

3240
03:02:25.810 --> 03:02:27.895
Alien is about survival,

3241
03:02:27.937 --> 03:02:31.190
aliens is about something bigger.

3242
03:02:31.691 --> 03:02:33.693
Aliens

3243
03:02:33.734 --> 03:02:35.736
this time it's war.

3244
03:02:36.821 --> 03:02:40.575
It's a war film in space.

3245
03:02:41.159 --> 03:02:42.910
Aliens, the draft,

3246
03:02:42.952 --> 03:02:45.997
the running name that Jim had,
was called grunts in space.

3247
03:02:46.998 --> 03:02:49.291
Cameron was writing Rambo ii

3248
03:02:49.292 --> 03:02:52.295
and aliens pretty much simultaneously.

3249
03:02:52.753 --> 03:02:56.632
And they kind of bled into one another
and aliens became a Vietnam film.

3250
03:02:56.966 --> 03:03:00.178
Subconsciously, it was sort of
about troops going under fire,

3251
03:03:00.595 --> 03:03:02.596
against an enemy they couldn't see.

3252
03:03:02.597 --> 03:03:03.347
Let's go! Let's go!

3253
03:03:03.389 --> 03:03:06.683
The other story was a story about
mothers and daughters. The queen

3254
03:03:06.684 --> 03:03:10.980
and her children fighting against
Ripley and her adopted child.

3255
03:03:13.316 --> 03:03:14.399
You instantly

3256
03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:18.236
feel for and need to rescue
this little girl who's seen her

3257
03:03:18.237 --> 03:03:22.074
parents killed and is still come up
with the wits to survive.

3258
03:03:23.534 --> 03:03:26.412
There's a very mythic and
primal thing going on here.

3259
03:03:26.662 --> 03:03:29.165
This is now mama bear versus mama bear.

3260
03:03:33.336 --> 03:03:35.838
Get away from her, you bitch!

3261
03:03:36.881 --> 03:03:38.465
At the time of filming, obviously,

3262
03:03:38.466 --> 03:03:42.469
I didn't really have any idea
of the magnitude

3263
03:03:42.470 --> 03:03:47.600
of the character Ripley, or the
character of vasquez or my character.

3264
03:03:47.892 --> 03:03:51.394
It was so important,
especially in the '80s, having

3265
03:03:51.395 --> 03:03:55.233
the female be the center of it,
the female with the flame thrower.

3266
03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:58.318
The females are the ones that are

3267
03:03:58.319 --> 03:04:00.029
taking charge.

3268
03:04:00.363 --> 03:04:02.532
Have you ever been
mistaken for a man?

3269
03:04:02.573 --> 03:04:04.283
No. Have you?

3270
03:04:04.325 --> 03:04:06.451
It began this movement,

3271
03:04:06.452 --> 03:04:09.705
a huge impact on the future

3272
03:04:09.747 --> 03:04:13.626
of action movies and sci fi movies.

3273
03:04:13.918 --> 03:04:15.126
We did operate

3274
03:04:15.127 --> 03:04:17.922
like as best as possible, a marine crew.

3275
03:04:18.589 --> 03:04:20.591
Al Matthews, sergeant apone.

3276
03:04:20.633 --> 03:04:23.134
All right sweethearts,
you heard the man

3277
03:04:23.135 --> 03:04:24.655
and you know the drill,
assholes and elbows...

3278
03:04:24.679 --> 03:04:27.431
He was, in fact, a former green beret,

3279
03:04:27.974 --> 03:04:31.394
so all of us Hollywood types,
you know, would demure

3280
03:04:31.978 --> 03:04:35.398
and avert him at all times.

3281
03:04:35.439 --> 03:04:37.440
What are you waiting for,
breakfast in bed?

3282
03:04:37.441 --> 03:04:37.692
Another glorious day in the corps.

3283
03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:40.902
The cohesiveness was really
formed in and around

3284
03:04:40.903 --> 03:04:43.864
training in the morning
and then also the rehearsal process.

3285
03:04:44.699 --> 03:04:48.119
And at that time, Hicks was
played by James remar.

3286
03:04:49.662 --> 03:04:51.580
Remar's involvement would have made it

3287
03:04:51.581 --> 03:04:53.791
even more intense.

3288
03:04:54.417 --> 03:04:57.587
Why he had to leave
had nothing to do with his acting.

3289
03:04:57.962 --> 03:05:01.007
However, it was quite shocking

3290
03:05:01.424 --> 03:05:04.176
to lose one of the leads of your film.

3291
03:05:05.344 --> 03:05:07.555
We all felt for Michael biehn.

3292
03:05:07.597 --> 03:05:09.140
Are you all right?

3293
03:05:09.181 --> 03:05:11.766
He literallyjumped into
remar's costume

3294
03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:14.020
and created his version of Hicks.

3295
03:05:14.437 --> 03:05:16.855
I'd like to keep this handy

3296
03:05:16.856 --> 03:05:18.274
for close encounters.

3297
03:05:18.316 --> 03:05:21.611
Bill Paxton was the glue of our set.

3298
03:05:21.652 --> 03:05:23.613
Check it out, I am
the ultimate badass!

3299
03:05:25.656 --> 03:05:27.032
And that's actually something

3300
03:05:27.033 --> 03:05:29.410
that sigourney Weaver
said at his memorial.

3301
03:05:29.452 --> 03:05:31.454
Yo! Stop your grinnin
and drop your linen.

3302
03:05:32.997 --> 03:05:36.167
To say we miss bill Paxton
is a true understatement.

3303
03:05:41.464 --> 03:05:43.674
Sometimes I'm still in awe,
like, oh my gosh,

3304
03:05:44.216 --> 03:05:46.969
I was in a James Cameron movie.

3305
03:05:47.011 --> 03:05:48.971
And they mostly come at night.

3306
03:05:49.013 --> 03:05:51.015
Mostly.

3307
03:05:51.098 --> 03:05:53.267
Sigourney just took care of me on set.

3308
03:05:55.269 --> 03:05:58.229
When we were in the eggs with the queen
alien in front of us and everything,

3309
03:05:58.230 --> 03:06:02.443
that was a very scary situation
with all the fire going on around us.

3310
03:06:03.486 --> 03:06:06.906
If you watch in the movie, she's going
like pushing me behind her.

3311
03:06:07.031 --> 03:06:10.033
That was a natural response.

3312
03:06:10.034 --> 03:06:12.911
I'm sure for everyone on set,
it was very difficult

3313
03:06:12.912 --> 03:06:14.997
and they probably were
a little bit concerned.

3314
03:06:16.666 --> 03:06:18.667
The last few years
that I've seen everyone,

3315
03:06:18.668 --> 03:06:20.669
they've actually asked,
did you have nightmares?

3316
03:06:20.670 --> 03:06:22.712
Did we like affect you psychologically?

3317
03:06:22.713 --> 03:06:24.214
And it didn't.

3318
03:06:24.215 --> 03:06:27.342
They would show me the process of building

3319
03:06:27.343 --> 03:06:30.388
something. They would show me
than how it was going to work.

3320
03:06:31.681 --> 03:06:33.223
Sometimes they'd throw something at me

3321
03:06:33.224 --> 03:06:36.852
to try to get my natural reaction
of a scare, different things like that.

3322
03:06:38.187 --> 03:06:40.271
At the time, I was definitely
afraid of dogs,

3323
03:06:40.272 --> 03:06:43.525
so I just pretended
like the aliens were dogs

3324
03:06:43.526 --> 03:06:45.778
coming after me.

3325
03:06:49.073 --> 03:06:53.035
This alien comes up and grabs me,
and it is terrifying,

3326
03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:57.330
however, for me, it was my friend
who was a stunt man in a suit

3327
03:06:57.331 --> 03:06:59.500
and then they put the head on,
and off we go.

3328
03:07:00.751 --> 03:07:05.004
To me, it was normal,
which is so abnormal,

3329
03:07:05.005 --> 03:07:07.633
really, if you look back at it.

3330
03:07:08.175 --> 03:07:12.513
Jim really took her under a wing and
made sure she was protected at all times,

3331
03:07:12.638 --> 03:07:17.268
and Paxton actually formed a really sort
of avuncular relationship with her.

3332
03:07:18.561 --> 03:07:22.690
When you got Lance, Paul Reiser and bill
Paxton together, there was trouble.

3333
03:07:22.732 --> 03:07:24.608
Keeping us all
light hearted, which is nice.

3334
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:27.111
What do you want me to do,
fetch your slippers for ya?

3335
03:07:27.153 --> 03:07:29.029
Gee, would you, sir?
I'd like that.

3336
03:07:29.071 --> 03:07:31.114
I'm always amazed
when I go to a convention

3337
03:07:31.115 --> 03:07:34.702
how many military people come up to me
and say before they deployed,

3338
03:07:34.869 --> 03:07:37.787
they watched aliens because
it brought that feeling of unity

3339
03:07:37.788 --> 03:07:38.998
together.

3340
03:07:39.039 --> 03:07:41.000
You're just too bad.

3341
03:07:42.460 --> 03:07:44.169
I had an amazing experience.

3342
03:07:44.170 --> 03:07:46.589
It was definitely once
in a lifetime opportunity.

3343
03:07:47.923 --> 03:07:49.925
Run!

3344
03:07:51.302 --> 03:07:53.554
When you come out and
you're up here on top,

3345
03:07:53.763 --> 03:07:56.849
how much further can you go?

3346
03:07:57.266 --> 03:07:59.685
Not bad for a human.

3347
03:08:11.906 --> 03:08:14.115
Flight of the navigator
was wish fulfillment

3348
03:08:14.116 --> 03:08:16.327
for every 12 year old.

3349
03:08:20.664 --> 03:08:22.833
It's a story about time travel,

3350
03:08:23.042 --> 03:08:26.670
about alien contact and connection,

3351
03:08:26.879 --> 03:08:30.841
futuristic technology,
creatures from other planets

3352
03:08:31.050 --> 03:08:34.929
and then under it,
the journey of David Freeman

3353
03:08:35.095 --> 03:08:38.224
to find his way back home
to his true family.

3354
03:08:40.559 --> 03:08:43.937
Time has changed for everyone except him.

3355
03:08:43.938 --> 03:08:47.066
He's still 12 years old
and his family has gotten older.

3356
03:08:47.107 --> 03:08:49.068
It seems that we...

3357
03:08:49.109 --> 03:08:50.653
David.

3358
03:08:50.694 --> 03:08:53.197
It's the story of how he adjusts

3359
03:08:53.447 --> 03:08:55.574
and how he tries to undo that problem.

3360
03:08:55.616 --> 03:08:57.617
Been gone for eight years.

3361
03:08:57.618 --> 03:08:59.620
Gone where, outer space?

3362
03:09:01.413 --> 03:09:04.959
We videotaped hundreds of
kids to find Joey cramer.

3363
03:09:05.292 --> 03:09:08.504
And when I saw him, I just knew
that that was the kid.

3364
03:09:08.546 --> 03:09:10.381
Let it go, let it go.

3365
03:09:10.422 --> 03:09:12.006
A key element in why

3366
03:09:12.007 --> 03:09:15.468
I got the part in flight of the navigator
was because of that

3367
03:09:15.469 --> 03:09:18.888
emotional availability,
being able to connect

3368
03:09:18.889 --> 03:09:21.225
and cry realistically.

3369
03:09:21.267 --> 03:09:23.560
It's like a bad dream.

3370
03:09:23.561 --> 03:09:27.814
The key to the whole movie
and the reason I think it still resonates

3371
03:09:27.815 --> 03:09:31.235
is the human drama.

3372
03:09:31.277 --> 03:09:33.237
It's 1986, man.

3373
03:09:33.279 --> 03:09:34.780
Eight years since that night.

3374
03:09:34.822 --> 03:09:35.656
Randal kleiser

3375
03:09:35.657 --> 03:09:39.284
was an amazing director and was able
to really bring things out of me

3376
03:09:39.285 --> 03:09:41.495
so I could really immerse
myself in that world.

3377
03:09:43.998 --> 03:09:47.834
The script was children,
special effects and animals,

3378
03:09:47.835 --> 03:09:52.548
which are all no no's, but I found it
to be an exciting challenge.

3379
03:09:52.590 --> 03:09:54.883
Just take us 20 miles from here.

3380
03:09:54.884 --> 03:09:56.886
Compliant.

3381
03:09:58.012 --> 03:10:00.514
What are you doing?

3382
03:10:00.556 --> 03:10:01.639
Mark Damon

3383
03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:04.851
wanted to make an action movie
with the government

3384
03:10:04.852 --> 03:10:08.272
trying to shoot down the spaceship
and lots of explosions and stuff.

3385
03:10:08.606 --> 03:10:10.649
And Disney wanted to make a family drama.

3386
03:10:11.025 --> 03:10:14.528
So I was caught in the middle
trying to make them both happy,

3387
03:10:14.612 --> 03:10:17.156
and I think that made the movie
a little more interesting.

3388
03:10:17.698 --> 03:10:19.782
Can you follow it?

3389
03:10:19.783 --> 03:10:21.785
Follow it? I can't even see it.

3390
03:10:22.077 --> 03:10:23.995
I wanted to find a spaceship
that was different

3391
03:10:23.996 --> 03:10:26.624
from all the movies I'd seen.

3392
03:10:27.958 --> 03:10:29.960
Wow!

3393
03:10:30.002 --> 03:10:31.378
Cutting edge cgi,

3394
03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:34.465
there's a little bit of it
in there, and it holds up.

3395
03:10:40.137 --> 03:10:43.599
When I first walked
into that set of the interior

3396
03:10:43.641 --> 03:10:49.604
spaceship, that cool, reflective mylar,
I rememberjust being blown away by it.

3397
03:10:49.605 --> 03:10:52.316
It was so cool.

3398
03:10:52.358 --> 03:10:54.234
- I'm a trimaxion drone ship.
- Trimaxion?

3399
03:10:54.276 --> 03:10:56.779
- Affirmative.
- Okay, I'll call you Max, it's easier.

3400
03:10:57.279 --> 03:10:59.697
We wanted this character of Max

3401
03:10:59.698 --> 03:11:03.994
to have a personality,
and yet he was a robot.

3402
03:11:04.036 --> 03:11:05.996
I'm just a kid.

3403
03:11:06.038 --> 03:11:08.957
That is obvious. But your brain
has been programmed

3404
03:11:08.958 --> 03:11:11.460
with all appropriate star charts.

3405
03:11:11.794 --> 03:11:14.295
Before the mine transfer, Max

3406
03:11:14.296 --> 03:11:18.049
just sounds like an alien spaceship,
and he's like, sit down navigator.

3407
03:11:18.050 --> 03:11:21.261
Sit down, navigator.

3408
03:11:21.345 --> 03:11:23.888
You would never know
that it was pee-wee Herman

3409
03:11:23.889 --> 03:11:26.350
or Paul Reubens.

3410
03:11:26.392 --> 03:11:28.184
I think there's been
some sort of mistake.

3411
03:11:28.185 --> 03:11:28.894
I do not make mistakes.

3412
03:11:28.936 --> 03:11:32.272
And then when he scans the boy's brain,

3413
03:11:32.356 --> 03:11:35.025
we let him do the character
pee-wee Herman.

3414
03:11:35.067 --> 03:11:37.027
- That's it?
- That's it Davy!

3415
03:11:38.821 --> 03:11:42.032
Working with the puppets
and that world was really cool.

3416
03:11:42.157 --> 03:11:46.078
They were all built into the set,
the space terrarium.

3417
03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:47.204
Weird.

3418
03:11:47.246 --> 03:11:49.580
I love the big eyeball.

3419
03:11:49.581 --> 03:11:52.042
I love you.

3420
03:11:53.752 --> 03:11:55.086
What's really special

3421
03:11:55.087 --> 03:11:57.423
about flight of the navigator
is the heart of it.

3422
03:12:00.134 --> 03:12:02.636
Losing the family, getting the
family back together,

3423
03:12:02.928 --> 03:12:07.057
it has that warm Disney feeling
without being saccharine, I hope.

3424
03:12:07.099 --> 03:12:08.934
Goodbye, Davy.

3425
03:12:08.976 --> 03:12:10.059
It was so much fun.

3426
03:12:10.060 --> 03:12:11.060
People love it.

3427
03:12:11.061 --> 03:12:13.313
I'm so proud and grateful
to be part of it.

3428
03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:15.315
See you later alligator!

3429
03:12:25.075 --> 03:12:28.077
George Lucas presents an
electrifying new comedy.

3430
03:12:28.078 --> 03:12:29.538
Howard the duck

3431
03:12:29.580 --> 03:12:33.250
Howard the duck is about a duck
that comes from outer space,

3432
03:12:33.333 --> 03:12:38.380
is sucked down accidentally by some laser
pointed in the wrong direction.

3433
03:12:42.593 --> 03:12:44.844
All he wants is to go home.

3434
03:12:44.845 --> 03:12:46.680
I've got no intention
of being stranded here.

3435
03:12:46.722 --> 03:12:47.847
Then he meets up with this

3436
03:12:47.848 --> 03:12:50.392
all girl band fronted by Lea Thompson.

3437
03:12:51.310 --> 03:12:53.352
I love the early comics.

3438
03:12:53.353 --> 03:12:57.483
Steve gerber, who created Howard for
the comics, was a friend of mine.

3439
03:12:58.734 --> 03:13:02.821
A lot of people went in and thought,
oh, Howard, cute, duck,

3440
03:13:03.322 --> 03:13:07.492
expecting much more of a family film,
and they had actually taken

3441
03:13:07.493 --> 03:13:11.037
the more adult storytelling of the Howard

3442
03:13:11.038 --> 03:13:13.582
the duck comics.

3443
03:13:13.624 --> 03:13:14.458
Must be mating season.

3444
03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:16.710
None of it was g-rated.

3445
03:13:19.379 --> 03:13:21.297
I love irreverent comedy.

3446
03:13:21.298 --> 03:13:23.342
Kids are just little adults

3447
03:13:23.801 --> 03:13:26.719
with a lack of discernment.
For me as a kid, I was like,

3448
03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:29.890
there's a talking duck and he's sassy.

3449
03:13:29.932 --> 03:13:33.518
Well, sex appeal. Some guys
got it, and some guys don't.

3450
03:13:33.519 --> 03:13:35.521
Howard...

3451
03:13:35.687 --> 03:13:37.606
This is great.

3452
03:13:38.232 --> 03:13:40.191
Lea Thompson was my girl.

3453
03:13:40.192 --> 03:13:42.736
She hugged me and she goes,
"oh, my mand duck.“

3454
03:13:43.278 --> 03:13:45.781
you are great, ducky.

3455
03:13:45.989 --> 03:13:48.074
Howard the duck
was my very first film, ever.

3456
03:13:48.075 --> 03:13:50.993
Lea was one who kept
whispering to me,

3457
03:13:50.994 --> 03:13:54.456
"listen, don't be afraid to say no"
because I did all the major stunts

3458
03:13:54.957 --> 03:13:55.957
except the airplane.

3459
03:14:00.921 --> 03:14:02.589
Well, they wanted Howard the duck

3460
03:14:02.631 --> 03:14:07.261
to be edgy and a doll, but they thought,
well, we got to make it a family film too.

3461
03:14:07.636 --> 03:14:10.681
And I don't know that
those two things really work.

3462
03:14:10.722 --> 03:14:13.183
It's so life-like and realistic!

3463
03:14:13.225 --> 03:14:14.393
Bug off!

3464
03:14:14.434 --> 03:14:17.228
Howard the duck is a pg rated
movie that opens

3465
03:14:17.229 --> 03:14:22.400
with a topless duck and duck boobs
if there is, in fact, such a thing.

3466
03:14:22.401 --> 03:14:23.734
And there are a few blue jokes

3467
03:14:23.735 --> 03:14:25.737
in Howard the duck,
Lea Thompson opens up

3468
03:14:25.779 --> 03:14:27.781
this wallet and finds a
sort of duck condom.

3469
03:14:27.823 --> 03:14:30.200
No, there's a condom in the wallet?

3470
03:14:30.367 --> 03:14:32.368
Why would they think
that's a family movie?

3471
03:14:32.369 --> 03:14:34.079
Crazy!

3472
03:14:34.121 --> 03:14:36.123
Howard...

3473
03:14:37.624 --> 03:14:39.333
Unfortunately, you got this vibe,

3474
03:14:39.334 --> 03:14:41.420
that the duck is going to do it
with Lea Thompson.

3475
03:14:41.461 --> 03:14:43.422
You could always give it a try.

3476
03:14:45.257 --> 03:14:47.301
He's a little cigar smoking horn dog,

3477
03:14:47.593 --> 03:14:50.971
and he gets the women on
his planet, so he's here.

3478
03:14:51.138 --> 03:14:55.767
So when in Rome... and he came on to
her and she called his bluff.

3479
03:14:56.977 --> 03:14:59.688
I just can't resist your intense
animal magnetism.

3480
03:15:00.189 --> 03:15:01.564
As an adult, seeing

3481
03:15:01.565 --> 03:15:05.444
Howard the duck wake up in a bed with a
human lady, it's a little questionable.

3482
03:15:05.485 --> 03:15:09.280
There were a lot of things going
against it and not enough going for it.

3483
03:15:09.281 --> 03:15:14.870
Willard huyck, Howard the duck was
definitely his first big budget production.

3484
03:15:16.163 --> 03:15:19.583
Willard would shoot 20, 30, 40
takes of just this...

3485
03:15:21.960 --> 03:15:24.755
Cut! Do it again.

3486
03:15:25.088 --> 03:15:27.633
Willard and Gloria didn't quite get it.

3487
03:15:28.258 --> 03:15:30.676
I saw the whole thing
going south, you know,

3488
03:15:30.677 --> 03:15:33.889
because they were having trouble
making decisions like in everything.

3489
03:15:34.890 --> 03:15:37.016
The director had a meltdown.

3490
03:15:37.017 --> 03:15:38.684
I had a meltdown, too.

3491
03:15:38.685 --> 03:15:41.437
And so Lucas came in to direct.

3492
03:15:41.438 --> 03:15:42.772
He didn't pull punches.

3493
03:15:42.773 --> 03:15:45.192
Not so passive aggressive,
more aggressive.

3494
03:15:45.609 --> 03:15:49.613
You and babyface are gonna
beat it! Right, Mr. Zits?

3495
03:15:49.655 --> 03:15:53.158
Before I get really mad!

3496
03:15:53.867 --> 03:15:54.992
The technology

3497
03:15:54.993 --> 03:15:59.039
just wasn't there
to make Howard believable.

3498
03:15:59.331 --> 03:16:03.669
And if you didn't believe Howard,
then the whole movie falls apart.

3499
03:16:04.753 --> 03:16:06.755
What's this?

3500
03:16:06.797 --> 03:16:09.132
The notion of an alien duck cracked me up.

3501
03:16:09.466 --> 03:16:12.969
Of all the alleys in the world I could
have fallen into that night.

3502
03:16:12.970 --> 03:16:14.972
Why did it have to be yours?

3503
03:16:15.555 --> 03:16:18.225
But at the end of the day,
it really is just a guy in a duck suit

3504
03:16:18.267 --> 03:16:22.062
telling dirty jokes, and I think that's
the ultimate problem of Howard the duck.

3505
03:16:22.854 --> 03:16:26.149
The duck wanted to do it with the girl.

3506
03:16:26.191 --> 03:16:28.986
This is not what you think.
We're just very good friends.

3507
03:16:36.994 --> 03:16:40.998
Star Trek iv: The voyage home

3508
03:16:41.915 --> 03:16:44.000
I know a good idea when I see one.

3509
03:16:44.001 --> 03:16:48.005
I knew that Star Trek iv was
going to be an enormous success.

3510
03:16:48.297 --> 03:16:50.507
I read it and I said,
"this story has it all."

3511
03:16:50.549 --> 03:16:52.550
Do not approach earth.

3512
03:16:52.551 --> 03:16:57.556
The transmissions of an orbiting probe
are causing critical damage to this planet.

3513
03:16:58.557 --> 03:17:01.727
Leonard nimoy had proven with star
trek III that he was a capable director.

3514
03:17:01.810 --> 03:17:03.937
So when it came time to
direct Star Trek iv,

3515
03:17:04.104 --> 03:17:06.106
he was then in a position to negotiate.

3516
03:17:06.273 --> 03:17:08.191
I want to do something different.

3517
03:17:08.233 --> 03:17:10.235
We're going to attempt
time travel.

3518
03:17:10.819 --> 03:17:13.006
And we're going to lighten things
up, we're going to have more fun.

3519
03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:16.115
Can you direct me to
the naval base in Alameda?

3520
03:17:16.116 --> 03:17:18.118
It's where they keep
the nuclear wessels.

3521
03:17:19.661 --> 03:17:20.953
I got to write comedy.

3522
03:17:20.954 --> 03:17:27.210
There was a previous draft of a story that
harve and Leonard had concocted together.

3523
03:17:27.336 --> 03:17:30.839
I was told that it had a big role
for Eddie Murphy.

3524
03:17:32.049 --> 03:17:35.634
My friend dawn Steele,
who was head of production at the time,

3525
03:17:35.635 --> 03:17:38.764
she said, “we have a problem,
we're going into production in a month.

3526
03:17:39.264 --> 03:17:40.348
We're not going to use the script.

3527
03:17:40.349 --> 03:17:42.517
We have to start over."

3528
03:17:42.809 --> 03:17:46.312
So I walked across the lot
to their office,

3529
03:17:46.313 --> 03:17:48.482
and they told me the story
about the whales.

3530
03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:52.986
As suspected, the drone's transmissions
are the songs sung by whales.

3531
03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:56.447
And harve said,
"I'll write the parts in outer space

3532
03:17:56.448 --> 03:17:59.742
and you write the parts on earth,
in San Francisco."

3533
03:17:59.743 --> 03:18:03.413
And I said, "San Francisco?
That's the same movie as time after time.“

3534
03:18:03.747 --> 03:18:05.748
can we go some place else?

3535
03:18:05.749 --> 03:18:07.500
Why can't we go to Paris?

3536
03:18:07.501 --> 03:18:08.709
And they said,

3537
03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:12.172
well, because the whales wouldn't
fit in the sand or some - you know.

3538
03:18:12.214 --> 03:18:17.843
And I took stuff that I'd cut out of time
after time and threw it into this movie.

3539
03:18:17.844 --> 03:18:20.889
You know, waste not want not
never throw anything away.

3540
03:18:25.435 --> 03:18:28.355
Very complicated to be in front
of the camera and behind the camera.

3541
03:18:28.855 --> 03:18:30.981
Star Trek iv is something
that he worked on

3542
03:18:30.982 --> 03:18:33.652
really heavily before they
ever shot it for the film.

3543
03:18:34.069 --> 03:18:36.863
He really knew what he was doing,
had a clear vision going in,

3544
03:18:36.905 --> 03:18:39.825
and I think that's what really saved him.

3545
03:18:39.866 --> 03:18:41.827
I'll give you 100 dollars.

3546
03:18:41.868 --> 03:18:43.745
Is that a lot?

3547
03:18:43.787 --> 03:18:46.248
Star Trek iv ends up
becoming a very accessible film,

3548
03:18:46.623 --> 03:18:50.168
even for non Star Trek fans.

3549
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:53.171
Why don't you watch where
you're going, you dumb-ass!

3550
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:55.632
Double dumb-ass on you!

3551
03:18:55.674 --> 03:18:56.882
Every laugh is earned,

3552
03:18:56.883 --> 03:18:59.218
every laugh is honest.

3553
03:18:59.219 --> 03:19:00.846
Everybody remember
where we parked.

3554
03:19:00.887 --> 03:19:03.723
I thought the scene between bill

3555
03:19:04.057 --> 03:19:07.477
and Leonard in the car was just charming.

3556
03:19:07.561 --> 03:19:09.312
It was just delightful.

3557
03:19:09.354 --> 03:19:11.355
You guys like Italian?

3558
03:19:11.356 --> 03:19:13.358
- No.
- Yes.

3559
03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:15.401
- No.
- Yes.

3560
03:19:15.402 --> 03:19:16.611
Yes, I love Italian.

3561
03:19:16.653 --> 03:19:18.362
At the end of the movie,

3562
03:19:18.363 --> 03:19:22.075
we took whale song and processed it
with some electronic stuff.

3563
03:19:24.619 --> 03:19:25.995
There's no dialog.

3564
03:19:25.996 --> 03:19:29.039
You have to tell the audience
that this is a communication

3565
03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:32.585
between whale in this
weird sci fi object,

3566
03:19:32.586 --> 03:19:35.672
there are sort of two distinct
sounds of the probe.

3567
03:19:35.714 --> 03:19:37.006
There's the danger mode.

3568
03:19:37.007 --> 03:19:39.009
I went in with my best designs.

3569
03:19:39.718 --> 03:19:42.052
Leonard, he said, "they don't work.

3570
03:19:42.053 --> 03:19:44.573
It should sound like this. And he went
'whab, whab, whab, whab'"

3571
03:19:44.931 --> 03:19:45.557
in this deep,

3572
03:19:45.558 --> 03:19:47.349
he's got this big, deep voice.

3573
03:19:47.350 --> 03:19:48.684
And I said, "great.

3574
03:19:48.685 --> 03:19:51.020
We're recording Leonard."

3575
03:19:51.021 --> 03:19:52.396
And he called my bluff.

3576
03:19:52.397 --> 03:19:55.065
And Leonard bellied up to the
microphone just like this and he went,

3577
03:19:55.066 --> 03:19:56.775
"whab, whab, whab, whab"

3578
03:19:56.776 --> 03:19:57.943
just like that.

3579
03:19:57.944 --> 03:20:00.155
And that's what's in the movie.

3580
03:20:03.825 --> 03:20:05.784
But the ultimate villain,

3581
03:20:05.785 --> 03:20:08.788
which is in Star Trek iv, is man.

3582
03:20:09.331 --> 03:20:12.917
Since the dawn of time, men
have harvested whals for a variety

3583
03:20:12.918 --> 03:20:16.254
of purposes. Most of which can be
achieved synthetically at this point.

3584
03:20:16.630 --> 03:20:17.922
The studio wanted to know

3585
03:20:17.923 --> 03:20:20.967
what the probe was asking or saying.

3586
03:20:23.345 --> 03:20:24.221
And I said

3587
03:20:24.222 --> 03:20:27.557
"that's dumb, could never live
up to the mystery."

3588
03:20:28.058 --> 03:20:29.642
I said, "we're not doing that.“

3589
03:20:29.643 --> 03:20:32.645
and I remember dawn Steele saying,
"you're wrong, Nicky Mayer."

3590
03:20:32.646 --> 03:20:36.399
And I said, "well, that's just how
the cookie is going to crumble."

3591
03:20:37.317 --> 03:20:39.777
Star Trek ii, III and iv

3592
03:20:39.778 --> 03:20:42.405
is my absolute favorite Star Trek trilogy.

3593
03:20:42.822 --> 03:20:44.741
It tells a really wonderful story.

3594
03:20:49.412 --> 03:20:52.207
No one was doing anything
like that at that time.

3595
03:20:52.457 --> 03:20:56.210
So to take these three movies
and really make them a cohesive trilogy

3596
03:20:56.211 --> 03:20:59.464
is really super beautiful.

3597
03:20:59.506 --> 03:21:01.507
Hello computer.

3598
03:21:01.508 --> 03:21:03.510
Just use the keyboard.

3599
03:21:09.724 --> 03:21:14.062
Music hits us on a very visceral level.

3600
03:21:17.566 --> 03:21:20.026
These beautiful, symphonic,

3601
03:21:20.402 --> 03:21:25.782
gorgeous scores that are bringing you
on a journey and advancing action.

3602
03:21:26.116 --> 03:21:30.620
A good composer picks a range
for a character. When they're sad,

3603
03:21:31.037 --> 03:21:33.665
and when they're happy
and when they're in action

3604
03:21:33.873 --> 03:21:36.626
and when they're resting.

3605
03:21:36.668 --> 03:21:38.628
Would anyone like to review
that for us today?

3606
03:21:39.129 --> 03:21:41.715
I think all good film
composers are chameleons,

3607
03:21:41.756 --> 03:21:45.009
if they're talented in a wide ranging way

3608
03:21:45.010 --> 03:21:48.179
for that career, you have to have
a wide open musical mind.

3609
03:21:49.139 --> 03:21:52.975
What really changed in
the '703 was really Steven Spielberg,

3610
03:21:52.976 --> 03:21:55.854
because he brought back the idea

3611
03:21:56.146 --> 03:21:58.648
that big orchestras are great.

3612
03:22:06.156 --> 03:22:09.826
And everybody followed suit because
those movies were making money.

3613
03:22:13.163 --> 03:22:14.330
It's very easy

3614
03:22:14.331 --> 03:22:18.084
to evoke the emotions of the film
by listening to the score.

3615
03:22:18.335 --> 03:22:21.504
The movie's already in your head,
so when you drop that needle on that vinyl

3616
03:22:21.713 --> 03:22:24.841
and close your eyes
and you listen to that opening score

3617
03:22:24.924 --> 03:22:27.885
for Superman or star wars,
you're right there,

3618
03:22:27.886 --> 03:22:29.304
you're back in the movie.

3619
03:22:36.061 --> 03:22:37.895
That music is huge.

3620
03:22:37.896 --> 03:22:43.234
It reminds you that this is a story
about an entire galaxy.

3621
03:22:43.401 --> 03:22:46.363
When you heard...

3622
03:22:50.992 --> 03:22:53.078
You know what's coming.

3623
03:22:53.453 --> 03:22:55.538
John Williams, certainly what he produced,

3624
03:22:55.664 --> 03:22:58.416
or created was monumental.

3625
03:22:58.541 --> 03:23:01.211
It made an unbelievable impact.

3626
03:23:03.004 --> 03:23:05.131
With the last starfighter,

3627
03:23:05.173 --> 03:23:08.927
the problem was you were in
the footsteps of star wars,

3628
03:23:09.260 --> 03:23:13.390
and if you go off and say, "hey, Nick,
let's do this electronically,

3629
03:23:13.515 --> 03:23:15.016
you're doomed."

3630
03:23:18.395 --> 03:23:20.814
So you had to respect

3631
03:23:21.147 --> 03:23:24.901
that your palate was going
to be a big symphony orchestra.

3632
03:23:25.443 --> 03:23:29.572
It's pretty normal when I'm explaining
what I want to do to a director

3633
03:23:30.156 --> 03:23:34.619
to just sing a melody
or try to imitate the sound.

3634
03:23:35.370 --> 03:23:38.455
When I played the theme
to the last starfighter,

3635
03:23:38.456 --> 03:23:41.334
I was sitting on a piano, going

3636
03:23:42.127 --> 03:23:45.213
"And now six trumpets play..."

3637
03:23:53.263 --> 03:23:56.683
They had to imagine it all
from a guy playing a piano.

3638
03:23:58.059 --> 03:24:00.103
That ain't easy.

3639
03:24:04.315 --> 03:24:06.150
Back to the future turns out to be

3640
03:24:06.151 --> 03:24:08.945
Alan Sylvester's very first
orchestral score.

3641
03:24:13.825 --> 03:24:16.034
Bob zemeckis said they
need your score to make

3642
03:24:16.035 --> 03:24:18.997
it feel like it's a much bigger
movie than it really is.

3643
03:24:19.122 --> 03:24:23.334
So al put together what
turned out to be, I'm told,

3644
03:24:23.752 --> 03:24:27.547
the biggest orchestra ever
assembled in Hollywood at that time.

3645
03:24:27.756 --> 03:24:29.299
Ai nailed it.

3646
03:24:36.347 --> 03:24:40.518
American movies are
partially basil poledouris

3647
03:24:40.727 --> 03:24:44.564
and partially Jerry goldsmith's.
Basil is much more epic.

3648
03:24:52.781 --> 03:24:54.949
You see the scenes through a filter.

3649
03:24:55.283 --> 03:24:58.119
The filter is the music.

3650
03:24:59.662 --> 03:25:02.372
Elmer Bernstein got to your heart in a way

3651
03:25:02.373 --> 03:25:05.335
that very few composers managed to do.

3652
03:25:15.011 --> 03:25:17.847
I trusted his laugh and his lack of laugh,

3653
03:25:18.139 --> 03:25:21.476
when it happened, and it gave
me confidence in what I was doing.

3654
03:25:22.185 --> 03:25:24.020
I love him and I really miss him.

3655
03:25:25.021 --> 03:25:27.815
One of the things that you have to do
when you make a movie and you have to show

3656
03:25:27.816 --> 03:25:29.919
the rough cut to anybody
is you have to put a temp track on it.

3657
03:25:29.943 --> 03:25:31.026
Composers generally

3658
03:25:31.027 --> 03:25:34.030
don't like to have to watch the movie
with somebody else's music on it.

3659
03:25:34.405 --> 03:25:37.283
The editor and the director are often

3660
03:25:37.575 --> 03:25:40.119
what we call married to their temp track.

3661
03:25:40.328 --> 03:25:44.122
And so now you find yourself
unwittingly turning your movie

3662
03:25:44.123 --> 03:25:48.336
into something that is cut to the rhythm
of the music that you're not going to use.

3663
03:25:48.795 --> 03:25:51.130
The most famous example of a temp track

3664
03:25:51.339 --> 03:25:53.800
would be 2001: A space odyssey,

3665
03:25:54.384 --> 03:25:59.514
in which Stanley kubrick temped
the entire movie with Richard Strauss,

3666
03:25:59.681 --> 03:26:03.977
Johann Strauss and then had a composer
and immediately went, "you know?

3667
03:26:04.477 --> 03:26:07.813
I think the temp track's way better than
what you did" and he threw out the score

3668
03:26:07.814 --> 03:26:08.857
and went back to the temp.

3669
03:26:16.322 --> 03:26:19.616
First, let me see your
film in musical silence,

3670
03:26:19.617 --> 03:26:24.122
because that's how my imagination
works in that blank slate plays.

3671
03:26:25.290 --> 03:26:29.877
Mr Cameron and Gale Anne hurd
came to my studio and showed me the rough

3672
03:26:29.878 --> 03:26:34.132
cut of the Terminator, without a temp
track. I was kind of blown away.

3673
03:26:35.300 --> 03:26:39.929
There was a very primitive early
sampling device called an emulator one.

3674
03:26:40.263 --> 03:26:43.056
You could plug a microphone
into this keyboard

3675
03:26:43.057 --> 03:26:47.353
and make some weird sound
and then reproduce it with the keyboard.

3676
03:26:47.395 --> 03:26:50.523
And that's how I did
the clank on Terminator.

3677
03:26:54.611 --> 03:26:57.696
I had this cheap little Mike
and I hit a frying pan

3678
03:26:57.697 --> 03:27:01.993
because I wanted this big ample sound
and I got an anvil sample.

3679
03:27:03.119 --> 03:27:05.622
It just sounded like...

3680
03:27:09.667 --> 03:27:11.293
That little piece of technology

3681
03:27:11.294 --> 03:27:14.672
was the key to establishing
the sound for the original Terminator.

3682
03:27:21.888 --> 03:27:23.890
Ben jealous from blade runner.

3683
03:27:24.515 --> 03:27:29.728
That was so strange and different and new,
he created these ambient

3684
03:27:29.729 --> 03:27:32.774
pads, which was a very
progressive idea in that day,

3685
03:27:32.815 --> 03:27:37.152
in a way that sound designers now very
commonly do, he'd create these emotive

3686
03:27:37.153 --> 03:27:42.032
kind of atmospheres that weren't music,
but he used synthesizers and chimes

3687
03:27:42.033 --> 03:27:45.244
and embedded them in scenes
to create an ambiance feel.

3688
03:27:54.003 --> 03:27:56.631
The soundtrack to repo man
is a little more my speed

3689
03:27:56.798 --> 03:27:59.717
than the soundtrack to blade runner.

3690
03:28:04.847 --> 03:28:08.809
They started flipping the script
a little bit by introducing modern

3691
03:28:08.810 --> 03:28:11.396
rock music into what should
be a science fiction film.

3692
03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:21.322
Excuse me.

3693
03:28:22.073 --> 03:28:26.034
Kirk Thatcher did the vocals for
I hate you and he wrote the lyrics,

3694
03:28:26.035 --> 03:28:30.790
I literally wrote a song in a lunchtime,
recorded it live in one take.

3695
03:28:31.249 --> 03:28:32.583
And he's the punk on the bus.

3696
03:28:39.257 --> 03:28:42.010
We just had a ton of fun doing it.

3697
03:28:42.135 --> 03:28:44.428
Today, there's very little thematic music.

3698
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:46.764
Music is more almost like a sound effect.

3699
03:28:53.771 --> 03:28:57.567
But in the '80s, there was a lot
of use of melody and themes.

3700
03:28:57.650 --> 03:29:00.778
There are so many great composers of
that era who wrote themes

3701
03:29:00.945 --> 03:29:03.865
and wrote melodies that you could hum
when you left the theater.

3702
03:29:04.115 --> 03:29:05.365
I love that.

3703
03:29:05.366 --> 03:29:07.159
That's one of the joys of cinema.

3704
03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:10.997
You can associate the moment in the score
with the images in the film

3705
03:29:11.372 --> 03:29:12.622
inside your head.

3706
03:29:12.623 --> 03:29:15.334
By the way, that's how you
know it's a good score.

3707
03:29:15.918 --> 03:29:19.004
This moment with that moment
will go together forever.

3708
03:29:19.005 --> 03:29:21.007
It's just a beautiful thing.

3709
03:29:33.519 --> 03:29:35.521
Arnold Schwarzenegger

3710
03:29:36.856 --> 03:29:38.858
predator

3711
03:29:38.900 --> 03:29:39.650
it was at the height

3712
03:29:39.651 --> 03:29:43.279
of the Rambo craze and the height
of the craze over aliens,

3713
03:29:43.446 --> 03:29:47.075
and all of a sudden
some whiz kid just said,

3714
03:29:48.826 --> 03:29:50.244
"put them together“.

3715
03:29:50.328 --> 03:29:54.082
I think in the '80s you saw
a transition in these kinds of movies

3716
03:29:54.290 --> 03:29:58.044
to something that was more
superhero in a way than hero

3717
03:29:58.252 --> 03:30:01.129
in a way. A branded physique.

3718
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:03.341
The heroes were all buffed up.

3719
03:30:03.508 --> 03:30:06.594
It was a time
where your physical appearance

3720
03:30:07.095 --> 03:30:09.597
determined your masculinity
in terms of buffness.

3721
03:30:11.432 --> 03:30:14.102
I was fond of predator
because it felt like the most uniquely

3722
03:30:14.268 --> 03:30:17.562
crafted Schwarzenegger film in which
he was allowed to be more of an actor,

3723
03:30:17.563 --> 03:30:19.899
he was allowed to be afraid and desperate.

3724
03:30:21.734 --> 03:30:23.735
Payback time.

3725
03:30:23.736 --> 03:30:26.572
We go down there expecting to do our jobs

3726
03:30:26.614 --> 03:30:28.950
as a rescue team.

3727
03:30:29.951 --> 03:30:31.953
Stick around.

3728
03:30:31.994 --> 03:30:34.664
But we end up becoming the hunted.

3729
03:30:34.705 --> 03:30:37.166
There's something in those trees.

3730
03:30:37.542 --> 03:30:40.418
I think what's great about
predator in the storytelling

3731
03:30:40.419 --> 03:30:46.384
is allowing the audience to understand
who the characters were beyond Arnold.

3732
03:30:47.844 --> 03:30:50.388
I think they did an outstanding job

3733
03:30:50.680 --> 03:30:53.141
of giving everyone in the platoon

3734
03:30:53.432 --> 03:30:56.309
their bit of time on screen.

3735
03:30:56.310 --> 03:30:58.728
The question is, do you care about anybody

3736
03:30:58.729 --> 03:31:00.481
that got shot?

3737
03:31:02.316 --> 03:31:04.777
I just like great writing.

3738
03:31:05.278 --> 03:31:08.614
I was the ultimate tough guy.

3739
03:31:12.994 --> 03:31:15.204
Of course, the most special scene for me

3740
03:31:15.329 --> 03:31:18.290
and the one where I'll brag and say,
I stole the film

3741
03:31:18.291 --> 03:31:19.709
from Arnold.

3742
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:22.043
You're hit, you're bleeding man.

3743
03:31:22.044 --> 03:31:23.921
I ain't got time to bleed.

3744
03:31:23.963 --> 03:31:27.884
And it almost didn't come about.
That scene got cut.

3745
03:31:27.925 --> 03:31:28.885
You've got time to duck?

3746
03:31:28.926 --> 03:31:30.510
And I'll never forget,

3747
03:31:30.511 --> 03:31:34.140
I can than montezuma's revenge,
because Arnold got sick

3748
03:31:34.682 --> 03:31:38.311
and Arnold couldn't shoot that day.

3749
03:31:38.436 --> 03:31:41.104
Predator is the one that everybody really
talks to me about.

3750
03:31:41.105 --> 03:31:43.107
The razor.

3751
03:31:43.149 --> 03:31:45.859
I'm gonna have me some fun tonight
when I'm going up the hill.

3752
03:31:45.860 --> 03:31:47.862
“I'm gonna have me some fun.

3753
03:31:47.904 --> 03:31:49.906
I'm gonna have me some fun.”

3754
03:31:50.198 --> 03:31:52.116
It still plays.

3755
03:31:56.078 --> 03:31:59.415
When I die, that's when
the platoon falls apart.

3756
03:31:59.498 --> 03:32:01.209
That's when panic set in.

3757
03:32:03.920 --> 03:32:05.462
These guys are really scared.

3758
03:32:05.463 --> 03:32:08.507
They're really big and muscular, and
they're dying and they're really dying.

3759
03:32:12.345 --> 03:32:14.722
The toughest guys in the world
who already know

3760
03:32:15.014 --> 03:32:17.934
that they're doomed,
this now becomes an existential movie.

3761
03:32:17.975 --> 03:32:20.144
There's something out there
waiting for us.

3762
03:32:21.270 --> 03:32:23.272
And it ain't no man.

3763
03:32:24.607 --> 03:32:26.776
Kevin Peter hall played the predator.

3764
03:32:27.276 --> 03:32:30.529
Kevin was the only one who
probably truly could have did the part,

3765
03:32:30.738 --> 03:32:34.325
because he had to be able to pick
Arnold up and make Arnold look small,

3766
03:32:34.867 --> 03:32:38.454
and he certainly did that.

3767
03:32:40.581 --> 03:32:45.169
John mctiernan knew what he was
doing in slowly revealing that character.

3768
03:32:48.381 --> 03:32:51.217
And it finally culminates
in one of the great reveals

3769
03:32:51.342 --> 03:32:55.471
in the history of sci fl,
and that's when the predator takes off

3770
03:32:55.596 --> 03:32:59.307
his bio helmet and reveals that face
with those mandibles.

3771
03:32:59.308 --> 03:33:02.853
And Arnold says,
"you one ugly motherfucker."

3772
03:33:05.648 --> 03:33:07.607
That is my favorite moment in that movie

3773
03:33:07.608 --> 03:33:10.611
when they have their final
mano a mano battle.

3774
03:33:10.861 --> 03:33:12.280
Predator reveals his face

3775
03:33:13.281 --> 03:33:16.242
drops his shoulder Cannon,
he's like, "let's go."

3776
03:33:16.617 --> 03:33:18.494
That's badass.

3777
03:33:20.913 --> 03:33:22.915
It just comes together as a thrill ride.

3778
03:33:23.165 --> 03:33:27.211
It's a perfect slice of what
pulp does best.

3779
03:33:28.838 --> 03:33:32.674
One of the prime examples
of testosterone driven

3780
03:33:32.675 --> 03:33:36.637
badass sci fi.

3781
03:33:36.887 --> 03:33:38.597
Yeah.

3782
03:33:38.639 --> 03:33:40.599
You son of a bitch.

3783
03:33:47.648 --> 03:33:49.649
Spaceballs

3784
03:33:49.650 --> 03:33:50.234
the movie.

3785
03:33:50.276 --> 03:33:51.193
The very first

3786
03:33:51.194 --> 03:33:56.574
joke of spaceballs is its title,
and everything after that is just one

3787
03:33:56.657 --> 03:33:58.617
joke after another.

3788
03:33:58.659 --> 03:34:00.619
May the Schwartz be with you.

3789
03:34:01.579 --> 03:34:03.580
Adorable.

3790
03:34:03.581 --> 03:34:04.748
All of this stuff kicked off

3791
03:34:04.749 --> 03:34:07.126
with star wars, obviously,
the very first shot of star wars.

3792
03:34:08.669 --> 03:34:14.132
You see the spaceship and it just goes on
and on and on. So many movies like just

3793
03:34:14.133 --> 03:34:17.969
absolutely copied star wars and said,
we need the giant

3794
03:34:17.970 --> 03:34:21.265
biggest spaceship ever.

3795
03:34:24.393 --> 03:34:26.562
When you think it's over,

3796
03:34:27.813 --> 03:34:29.690
it's not over.

3797
03:34:32.193 --> 03:34:34.820
And then when you think it's over,

3798
03:34:36.155 --> 03:34:38.616
it's still not over.

3799
03:34:39.909 --> 03:34:40.534
Mel Brooks

3800
03:34:40.535 --> 03:34:45.206
was able to take satire
and make it into a blockbuster.

3801
03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:52.922
Oh, no. Not again!

3802
03:34:52.963 --> 03:34:55.048
He honored the genre,

3803
03:34:55.049 --> 03:34:58.344
whether with history of the
world, part 1, blazing saddles.

3804
03:34:58.719 --> 03:35:01.722
He was able to truly understand the genre

3805
03:35:01.972 --> 03:35:04.475
he was trying to make fun of.

3806
03:35:04.517 --> 03:35:07.478
Dear me, what are those
things coming out of her nose?

3807
03:35:08.979 --> 03:35:10.563
Highbrow jokes

3808
03:35:10.564 --> 03:35:15.069
that really invited you in
to intellectually

3809
03:35:15.277 --> 03:35:18.697
make fun of the world
we were currently living in.

3810
03:35:18.739 --> 03:35:20.699
Spaceballs!

3811
03:35:22.243 --> 03:35:23.410
Breaking that fourth,

3812
03:35:23.411 --> 03:35:27.206
fifth, sixth, seventh wall.

3813
03:35:30.042 --> 03:35:32.044
Uhm, he did it.

3814
03:35:32.086 --> 03:35:35.297
He's making fun of the commercials
that we're watching on TV.

3815
03:35:35.339 --> 03:35:38.800
He's making fun of what happens
when we eat that much fast food

3816
03:35:38.801 --> 03:35:42.763
and we become what we eat.

3817
03:35:42.805 --> 03:35:44.765
The notorious gangster
became locked in his car

3818
03:35:44.807 --> 03:35:46.058
and ate himself to death.

3819
03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:47.017
You satirize

3820
03:35:47.018 --> 03:35:50.645
what it means to be
a completely vain society

3821
03:35:50.646 --> 03:35:55.191
that wastes all of its natural
resources and then goes and tries

3822
03:35:55.192 --> 03:35:57.611
to take those resources
from another planet.

3823
03:35:57.653 --> 03:36:00.030
Suck! Suck!

3824
03:36:04.118 --> 03:36:05.201
In spaceballs,

3825
03:36:05.202 --> 03:36:08.038
they talked about the
hilariousness of merchandizing.

3826
03:36:08.372 --> 03:36:11.041
I mean, that was how George Lucas
made all his money.

3827
03:36:11.167 --> 03:36:11.917
How did he know?

3828
03:36:11.918 --> 03:36:13.919
What is it that you do here?

3829
03:36:13.961 --> 03:36:14.962
Merchandizing.

3830
03:36:15.004 --> 03:36:16.629
Merchandizing.

3831
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:17.922
Where the real money from the -

3832
03:36:17.923 --> 03:36:19.550
- movie is made.

3833
03:36:19.592 --> 03:36:21.259
Spaceballs the lunchbox!

3834
03:36:21.260 --> 03:36:22.553
Spaceballs the breakfast cereal!

3835
03:36:22.595 --> 03:36:26.515
Spaceballs is the flame thrower.

3836
03:36:26.557 --> 03:36:27.993
Flame thrower!
The kids love this one.

3837
03:36:28.017 --> 03:36:29.852
That was just nuts.

3838
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:34.565
Dinks, first speaking role, by the way.

3839
03:36:34.607 --> 03:36:35.774
Dink dink.

3840
03:36:35.816 --> 03:36:37.818
Dink dink,
dink dink dink dink dink dink.

3841
03:36:38.235 --> 03:36:41.362
To this day, I don't know
what the dinks really did.

3842
03:36:41.363 --> 03:36:42.114
I don't care.

3843
03:36:42.115 --> 03:36:44.909
I was working with John candy.

3844
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:46.911
I'm my own best friend.

3845
03:36:46.952 --> 03:36:48.329
Give me paw!

3846
03:36:48.370 --> 03:36:51.956
Bill Pullman, Daphne zuniga.

3847
03:36:51.957 --> 03:36:53.959
He shot my hair!

3848
03:36:54.001 --> 03:36:56.003
Son of a bitch!

3849
03:36:57.963 --> 03:36:59.464
Shields and yarnell

3850
03:36:59.465 --> 03:37:03.052
lorene yarnell was the gold robot
that Joan rivers voiced.

3851
03:37:03.093 --> 03:37:05.387
Will you turn that thing off?!

3852
03:37:06.305 --> 03:37:08.307
What?

3853
03:37:08.349 --> 03:37:10.351
What is it?

3854
03:37:10.476 --> 03:37:12.644
We were in on the joke

3855
03:37:12.645 --> 03:37:15.314
and it was peak Rick moranis.

3856
03:37:15.356 --> 03:37:17.733
Oh, your helmet is so big!

3857
03:37:18.275 --> 03:37:20.277
Dark helmet!

3858
03:37:25.991 --> 03:37:29.537
Michael winslow has this unique talent.

3859
03:37:32.164 --> 03:37:34.166
And the creeps.

3860
03:37:35.251 --> 03:37:37.210
I'm sure there's more on
the cutting room floor.

3861
03:37:37.211 --> 03:37:39.672
There's no way there's not.

3862
03:37:40.047 --> 03:37:41.631
It shows how diverse

3863
03:37:41.632 --> 03:37:45.052
the cast was in their skills.

3864
03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:48.096
It feels like all

3865
03:37:48.097 --> 03:37:52.601
the worlds are just colliding in this one
little mini comedic universe

3866
03:37:52.810 --> 03:37:55.813
that we're all waiting for
spaceballs ii to come out for.

3867
03:37:55.854 --> 03:37:58.816
God's willing we'll all meet
again in spaceballs ll:

3868
03:37:58.857 --> 03:38:00.859
The search for more money.

3869
03:38:00.943 --> 03:38:02.319
Still waiting.

3870
03:38:02.361 --> 03:38:05.322
Hello, my baby. Hello, my honey.

3871
03:38:05.364 --> 03:38:07.366
Hello, my ragtime gal.

3872
03:38:12.705 --> 03:38:14.290
Dennis quaid

3873
03:38:14.331 --> 03:38:15.916
Martin short

3874
03:38:16.041 --> 03:38:19.043
give yourself a shot
of adventure.

3875
03:38:19.044 --> 03:38:21.046
Innerspace

3876
03:38:21.297 --> 03:38:24.216
innerspace is about
technology gone awry.

3877
03:38:24.675 --> 03:38:27.343
The first person that can put someone
inside someone's body

3878
03:38:27.344 --> 03:38:29.555
and use them to kill them is the winner.

3879
03:38:32.141 --> 03:38:33.266
When innerspace came to me,

3880
03:38:33.267 --> 03:38:36.937
it was a picture that
Peter guber and John Peters owned.

3881
03:38:37.104 --> 03:38:38.271
And it was not a comedy.

3882
03:38:38.272 --> 03:38:39.606
It was a straight

3883
03:38:39.607 --> 03:38:43.193
spy movie with the plot of a guy who gets
shrunk down and put inside another guy.

3884
03:38:43.944 --> 03:38:48.324
I suggested diplomatically
that people would laugh at this idea,

3885
03:38:48.657 --> 03:38:50.283
and then they came back and they had hired

3886
03:38:50.284 --> 03:38:53.871
Jeffrey boam, who was a very
good writer, and he had come

3887
03:38:54.496 --> 03:38:57.373
to it with a different idea,
which was what would happen

3888
03:38:57.374 --> 03:39:00.544
if Dean Martin was shrunk down
and injected into Jerry Lewis.

3889
03:39:01.545 --> 03:39:05.090
And that was something that as a Martin
and Lewis fan of my youth,

3890
03:39:05.132 --> 03:39:08.302
I could certainly relate to,
and I said, "yes, now this works.

3891
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:09.802
Now it's funny."

3892
03:39:09.803 --> 03:39:11.930
That's when Steven
Spielberg became involved.

3893
03:39:13.766 --> 03:39:17.895
When fantastic voyage was made,
it used the best technology.

3894
03:39:18.854 --> 03:39:21.273
Everything in it was
cutting edge for the time.

3895
03:39:24.401 --> 03:39:25.902
When we did innerspace,

3896
03:39:25.903 --> 03:39:31.449
of course, the technology has improved
so much, and we've gone so far ahead

3897
03:39:31.450 --> 03:39:35.371
in leaps and bounds.

3898
03:39:35.871 --> 03:39:37.872
I loved all the practical stuff

3899
03:39:37.873 --> 03:39:39.123
in that movie.

3900
03:39:39.124 --> 03:39:40.750
Just relax, Jack.

3901
03:39:40.751 --> 03:39:42.252
Let's see what's going on in here.

3902
03:39:42.294 --> 03:39:44.587
And how realistic they looked

3903
03:39:44.588 --> 03:39:46.882
prior to the advent
of any sort of computer

3904
03:39:47.341 --> 03:39:48.425
graphics.

3905
03:39:48.467 --> 03:39:50.469
Entering blood street.

3906
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:57.767
You know, things like him
flying through the bloodstream

3907
03:39:57.768 --> 03:40:01.229
with the red blood cells
or seeing out of

3908
03:40:01.230 --> 03:40:03.023
Martin short's eyes.

3909
03:40:03.065 --> 03:40:05.025
Firing optic sensor.

3910
03:40:09.613 --> 03:40:11.155
And then you have the battle
inside the car

3911
03:40:11.156 --> 03:40:13.826
where there's a very clever
use of force perspective.

3912
03:40:16.995 --> 03:40:18.413
If you're working
with Martin short,

3913
03:40:18.414 --> 03:40:21.458
if you do ten takes, take ten is like
from a different movie than take one.

3914
03:40:21.542 --> 03:40:23.877
He likes to discover.
He likes to try new things.

3915
03:40:25.087 --> 03:40:29.091
Jack, you've just
digested the bad guy.

3916
03:40:30.592 --> 03:40:33.303
He and Dennis are never on screen together,
except at the very end.

3917
03:40:33.387 --> 03:40:35.179
But yet it wasn't going
to work to pre-record

3918
03:40:35.180 --> 03:40:37.683
Dennis's dialog
or pre-record Martin's dialog.

3919
03:40:38.225 --> 03:40:40.518
So our sound guy,
Ken kahn, came up with an idea

3920
03:40:40.519 --> 03:40:42.730
that allowed them to talk to each other
during takes.

3921
03:40:42.771 --> 03:40:45.899
So whenever I did a scene with Marty,
Dennis would still be there off screen

3922
03:40:46.233 --> 03:40:50.194
and they could talk to each other
and they could improvise.

3923
03:40:50.195 --> 03:40:52.197
In here, inside you.
Inside your body!

3924
03:40:52.239 --> 03:40:54.241
Somebody help me!

3925
03:40:54.283 --> 03:40:56.285
I'm possessed!!!

3926
03:40:56.368 --> 03:40:59.996
One of the reasons that their relationship
in the movie works so well is

3927
03:40:59.997 --> 03:41:03.166
because it's actually a real relationship
that they were having

3928
03:41:03.167 --> 03:41:04.585
at the moment.

3929
03:41:04.626 --> 03:41:06.627
You have seen parts of my body

3930
03:41:06.628 --> 03:41:08.630
that I will never get to see.

3931
03:41:08.672 --> 03:41:10.674
Believe me, you're
not missing all that much.

3932
03:41:13.010 --> 03:41:16.764
I love my character in the film,
just a malevolent presence.

3933
03:41:16.972 --> 03:41:18.055
He didn't talk.

3934
03:41:18.056 --> 03:41:20.517
He was just there.

3935
03:41:23.061 --> 03:41:23.812
My hand,

3936
03:41:23.813 --> 03:41:26.815
I had a multitude of things,
which was kind of fun.

3937
03:41:28.525 --> 03:41:31.652
The gun, the flame thrower,
an automatic submachine gun,

3938
03:41:31.653 --> 03:41:36.241
which we don't see because that scene
was taken out of the film. And the sex toy.

3939
03:41:37.493 --> 03:41:39.495
Yeah, the sex toy.

3940
03:41:40.537 --> 03:41:42.748
Very quick, but you see it.

3941
03:41:44.041 --> 03:41:46.125
They had this rig that they put me in.

3942
03:41:46.126 --> 03:41:49.629
Then they lowered it down into the floor,
which is where I get

3943
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:51.048
shrunk down.

3944
03:41:53.675 --> 03:41:56.094
I have a fear of claustrophobia.

3945
03:41:57.095 --> 03:42:00.390
I was sweating bullets,
really, hated it.

3946
03:42:06.146 --> 03:42:09.608
It went very smoothly, and everybody
liked the movie when they saw it.

3947
03:42:09.691 --> 03:42:10.275
And the only thing

3948
03:42:10.317 --> 03:42:13.695
that I will say, that terrible ad campaign,
and so it didn't make any money.

3949
03:42:14.196 --> 03:42:17.699
But aside from that,
it was a great experience.

3950
03:42:21.411 --> 03:42:23.413
The future of law enforcement.

3951
03:42:23.455 --> 03:42:26.457
Robocop

3952
03:42:26.458 --> 03:42:29.544
robocop has all of those elements

3953
03:42:29.545 --> 03:42:32.631
that make greatness in cinema
and storytelling.

3954
03:42:33.966 --> 03:42:38.512
The fight for dignity,
the human condition at stake, humor.

3955
03:42:38.554 --> 03:42:40.556
I'd buy that for a dollar!

3956
03:42:42.391 --> 03:42:46.270
A slap in the face of society.

3957
03:42:48.146 --> 03:42:50.816
I called my agent and I said,
"they're changing his title, right?

3958
03:42:50.858 --> 03:42:52.650
It's not going to be the title."

3959
03:42:52.651 --> 03:42:54.987
Who's going to go see
a movie called robocop?

3960
03:42:55.571 --> 03:42:58.115
Boy, was I wrong about that.

3961
03:42:59.157 --> 03:43:01.200
In the beginning, for me, was very weird,

3962
03:43:01.201 --> 03:43:05.122
because Peter weller said to me,
"you have to call me robocop.

3963
03:43:05.914 --> 03:43:08.791
You cannot call me Peter."

3964
03:43:08.792 --> 03:43:11.044
So there was already some tension,
you know?

3965
03:43:13.338 --> 03:43:15.674
The robo suit ten hours later,

3966
03:43:16.383 --> 03:43:19.636
we're sitting there going,
oh my god.

3967
03:43:19.887 --> 03:43:21.179
He was so frustrated.

3968
03:43:21.221 --> 03:43:24.308
In fact, in the very first weeks,
there was a crisis.

3969
03:43:24.516 --> 03:43:27.728
They were thinking of
pulling the plug on on the film.

3970
03:43:29.021 --> 03:43:30.771
They literally had to assemble him.

3971
03:43:30.772 --> 03:43:33.358
It was like a toy, putting him
together with a screwdriver.

3972
03:43:34.860 --> 03:43:36.986
Every time I started feeling
sorry for myself,

3973
03:43:36.987 --> 03:43:40.782
I just looked at Peter,
who was in this big plastic thing.

3974
03:43:42.117 --> 03:43:43.826
And they got it down to about

3975
03:43:43.827 --> 03:43:45.913
three or four hours.

3976
03:43:45.954 --> 03:43:47.915
It's not as easy as it looks.

3977
03:43:48.916 --> 03:43:51.000
Robo teams robocop.

3978
03:43:51.001 --> 03:43:54.629
It's robocop lore, the battles
he had with Paul verhoeven

3979
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:57.549
and I was there for many
of those battles in Rob's studio.

3980
03:43:59.009 --> 03:44:01.929
The way Rob sculpted that,
the way it was painted,

3981
03:44:01.970 --> 03:44:05.307
the finish on that machine,
it's a piece of art.

3982
03:44:07.768 --> 03:44:09.770
Drop it!

3983
03:44:09.811 --> 03:44:11.312
The shooting experience,

3984
03:44:11.313 --> 03:44:14.942
it was like this fast moving train,
and the film had that energy to it.

3985
03:44:15.025 --> 03:44:20.197
We felt so creative and we were so loose,
it was everything but was in the script.

3986
03:44:20.614 --> 03:44:24.493
I thought that it should have a different
style than American action movie,

3987
03:44:24.534 --> 03:44:28.914
that it should be partially light hearted,
that it should be a bit funny,

3988
03:44:29.039 --> 03:44:32.793
that you would be a bit amazed.

3989
03:44:32.834 --> 03:44:34.836
Can you fly, Bobby?

3990
03:44:36.838 --> 03:44:40.342
Clarence boddicker,
he's having a great time.

3991
03:44:40.384 --> 03:44:41.510
Bitches leave.

3992
03:44:41.551 --> 03:44:44.054
He's this sociopath.

3993
03:44:44.096 --> 03:44:45.856
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

3994
03:44:45.889 --> 03:44:47.098
You can't get crazy with it

3995
03:44:47.099 --> 03:44:49.476
because he still has
to be taken seriously.

3996
03:44:49.518 --> 03:44:51.436
Cops don't like me.

3997
03:44:51.478 --> 03:44:52.853
With the language,

3998
03:44:52.854 --> 03:44:56.733
I kept adding things, especially f-bombs,
I was big on

3999
03:44:56.817 --> 03:44:58.860
throwing those in all the time.

4000
03:44:58.902 --> 03:45:01.071
I don't want to fuck
with you, sal.

4001
03:45:01.196 --> 03:45:02.656
Bad guys,

4002
03:45:02.823 --> 03:45:05.158
they never think they're bad.

4003
03:45:05.200 --> 03:45:07.785
This corporation will live up
to the guiding principles

4004
03:45:07.786 --> 03:45:10.622
of its founder: Courage,
strength, conviction.

4005
03:45:11.456 --> 03:45:12.707
There is a vague

4006
03:45:12.708 --> 03:45:15.293
religious component to robocop,

4007
03:45:15.419 --> 03:45:19.965
of course, because I felt that
the death of Murphy

4008
03:45:20.132 --> 03:45:22.759
should be a crucifixion
because there was a resurrection.

4009
03:45:23.301 --> 03:45:25.512
That's why that scene
is extremely violent,

4010
03:45:25.762 --> 03:45:29.891
because crucifixion is one of the worst
punishments that you can imagine.

4011
03:45:31.351 --> 03:45:33.437
Paul grew up in world war ii.

4012
03:45:34.021 --> 03:45:36.188
He saw real violence.

4013
03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:40.651
His whole concept of
the violence in robocop

4014
03:45:40.652 --> 03:45:44.488
is he wanted it to be so over
the top that you got the joke

4015
03:45:44.489 --> 03:45:46.283
immediately.

4016
03:45:46.324 --> 03:45:49.118
You have 20 seconds to comply.

4017
03:45:49.119 --> 03:45:52.247
I think you'd better
do what he says, Mr. Kinney.

4018
03:45:52.372 --> 03:45:54.499
Oddly enough, they cut it back so much so

4019
03:45:54.541 --> 03:45:58.462
that it finally got to where it was
right on the edge of what you could stand.

4020
03:46:00.839 --> 03:46:02.381
They made the violence

4021
03:46:02.382 --> 03:46:05.927
more egregious by doing it that way.

4022
03:46:06.011 --> 03:46:09.346
That's non-artistic
people trying to make decisions

4023
03:46:09.347 --> 03:46:12.809
that they have no business making.

4024
03:46:14.019 --> 03:46:16.937
Ed-209 really wanted to emphasize

4025
03:46:16.938 --> 03:46:20.525
the stupidity of
American automobile design.

4026
03:46:20.692 --> 03:46:25.489
And so I proposed to Paul
that we build a full scale ed-209.

4027
03:46:30.577 --> 03:46:32.913
When ed falls down the stairs,

4028
03:46:33.288 --> 03:46:37.834
the sound effects was a baby pigs
getting their throat slit.

4029
03:46:44.382 --> 03:46:46.635
Shootouts, things blowing up.

4030
03:46:47.385 --> 03:46:50.555
It was a pretty active show.

4031
03:46:50.597 --> 03:46:52.766
Guns going off and car crashes,

4032
03:46:53.308 --> 03:46:55.435
it was pretty exciting.

4033
03:46:56.770 --> 03:46:59.106
One of the things that Nancy

4034
03:46:59.272 --> 03:47:03.275
and her character,
Louis were really responsible for,

4035
03:47:03.276 --> 03:47:07.614
within the movie, was bringing
robocop back to his humanity.

4036
03:47:07.656 --> 03:47:10.951
Murphy, it's you.

4037
03:47:11.576 --> 03:47:12.701
It really was about

4038
03:47:12.702 --> 03:47:17.082
the human connection that I had
with this part human character.

4039
03:47:17.415 --> 03:47:18.917
The soul was really still there.

4040
03:47:20.460 --> 03:47:24.923
Parable of loss of who are you

4041
03:47:25.465 --> 03:47:27.175
when that's gone.

4042
03:47:27.217 --> 03:47:29.719
Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?

4043
03:47:30.846 --> 03:47:33.013
The scene when he
goes to his house

4044
03:47:33.014 --> 03:47:36.977
and it's empty,
it just made me almost cry,

4045
03:47:37.060 --> 03:47:39.521
and that's when I said,
this is a really good movie.

4046
03:47:39.563 --> 03:47:41.523
Can you that, dad?

4047
03:47:45.610 --> 03:47:47.903
It's a sad frigging movie, man,

4048
03:47:47.904 --> 03:47:52.242
it is a poignantly sad, sad, though,
even at the end, he said,

4049
03:47:52.284 --> 03:47:53.160
"what's your name, kid?“

4050
03:47:53.161 --> 03:47:55.077
"Murphy."

4051
03:47:55.078 --> 03:47:57.622
Okay, he's got something back, right?

4052
03:47:58.165 --> 03:47:59.832
But he doesn't have it back, Matt.

4053
03:47:59.833 --> 03:48:01.334
That's gone.

4054
03:48:01.376 --> 03:48:03.336
He's not a guy, he's a machine.

4055
03:48:03.378 --> 03:48:04.605
What are they gonna do,
replace us?

4056
03:48:04.629 --> 03:48:05.963
I like when a good film

4057
03:48:05.964 --> 03:48:09.300
will present those ideas
and do it in a humorous way,

4058
03:48:09.301 --> 03:48:12.304
but enough that it gets your attention
and gets you to think about it.

4059
03:48:13.221 --> 03:48:15.514
Robocop was urban dystopia.

4060
03:48:15.515 --> 03:48:17.851
I based it on elements that I saw.

4061
03:48:18.059 --> 03:48:23.982
Of course, it was happening in society
already, but were not visible yet.

4062
03:48:24.065 --> 03:48:28.152
But now we are here.

4063
03:48:28.153 --> 03:48:29.821
The power of its messages
trickle down

4064
03:48:29.863 --> 03:48:33.908
economics of the privatization
of the world and capitalism

4065
03:48:33.909 --> 03:48:35.243
run amok.

4066
03:48:35.285 --> 03:48:37.245
Yes.

4067
03:48:39.623 --> 03:48:41.874
I was not aware of how long lasting

4068
03:48:41.875 --> 03:48:46.254
the social strata of robocop would last.

4069
03:48:46.296 --> 03:48:48.172
I don't know. It's a one off man.

4070
03:48:48.173 --> 03:48:50.966
That movie is extraordinary.

4071
03:48:50.967 --> 03:48:53.886
Excuse me, robo, any special message
for all the kids watching at home?

4072
03:48:53.887 --> 03:48:55.889
Stay out of trouble.

4073
03:49:04.981 --> 03:49:06.983
The running man

4074
03:49:07.025 --> 03:49:11.446
what running man did. It
predated reality TV.

4075
03:49:11.488 --> 03:49:15.784
The running man:
America's favorite game show.

4076
03:49:17.244 --> 03:49:20.037
Running man is kind of dead on to

4077
03:49:20.038 --> 03:49:24.376
what happened with reality TV,
only in the case of the running man,

4078
03:49:24.668 --> 03:49:29.839
the reality was termination,
which we have unfortunately got to,

4079
03:49:29.965 --> 03:49:33.176
but I'll say yet.

4080
03:49:33.218 --> 03:49:35.220
It's time to start running!

4081
03:49:36.096 --> 03:49:39.849
Richard Dawson was your perfect
comedic bad guy.

4082
03:49:39.891 --> 03:49:42.686
He was just playing the role
he did on family feud.

4083
03:49:42.727 --> 03:49:45.522
Come on, let's play the feud,
let's go.

4084
03:49:46.273 --> 03:49:48.315
It made perfect sense to me.

4085
03:49:48.316 --> 03:49:52.821
I'd like you to volunteer
to appear on tomorrow's broadcast.

4086
03:49:53.446 --> 03:49:55.406
Halfway through filming predator,

4087
03:49:55.407 --> 03:49:58.909
Arnold came up to me on the set
and he said, "my next film this fall

4088
03:49:58.910 --> 03:50:02.289
is called the running man, there's a part
in there you're perfect for."

4089
03:50:02.330 --> 03:50:06.293
This is a sport of death and honor!
Code of the gladiators!

4090
03:50:06.918 --> 03:50:07.752
By the time

4091
03:50:07.794 --> 03:50:11.381
my part got there,
they were on their third director.

4092
03:50:11.715 --> 03:50:14.633
Fortunately for me, that director was

4093
03:50:14.634 --> 03:50:16.511
Paul Michael glaser.

4094
03:50:18.054 --> 03:50:21.641
Daven, here in the locker room,
there's a lot of excitment here.

4095
03:50:21.766 --> 03:50:23.600
Captain freedom, my character

4096
03:50:23.601 --> 03:50:27.355
in running man,
he was the greatest stalker of all time,

4097
03:50:27.647 --> 03:50:31.484
and he got old and like all old stalkers,

4098
03:50:31.526 --> 03:50:34.778
he ends up with a microphone.

4099
03:50:34.779 --> 03:50:36.322
Are you ready for pay?

4100
03:50:36.323 --> 03:50:36.823
Are you ready for suffering?

4101
03:50:36.865 --> 03:50:39.951
Running man was on the edge of technology

4102
03:50:40.201 --> 03:50:43.830
predicted in the movie
that has become reality today.

4103
03:50:44.456 --> 03:50:48.918
Maria conchita goes into her apartment
and starts turning things on by voice.

4104
03:50:49.127 --> 03:50:51.421
Well, that's a common practice now.

4105
03:50:51.463 --> 03:50:55.967
- Kitchen, Some coffee.
- Channel one.

4106
03:50:57.427 --> 03:50:58.927
We've already reached the running man

4107
03:50:58.928 --> 03:51:02.473
stage of technology.

4108
03:51:02.474 --> 03:51:04.308
There's a very crude,

4109
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:10.147
1980's style sort of digital frame to make
you think that one person is there

4110
03:51:10.148 --> 03:51:12.816
when in actuality, it's someone else.

4111
03:51:12.817 --> 03:51:14.527
You'll never know the difference.

4112
03:51:14.569 --> 03:51:15.111
All right boys.

4113
03:51:15.153 --> 03:51:15.779
Running man

4114
03:51:15.780 --> 03:51:18.782
definitely predicted
deepfake technologies.

4115
03:51:19.074 --> 03:51:20.992
They created this phony fight.

4116
03:51:25.622 --> 03:51:26.581
Peter Kent,

4117
03:51:26.582 --> 03:51:29.584
I ended up fighting Peter
because Arnold wouldn't take a suplex.

4118
03:51:31.252 --> 03:51:34.964
He made Peter do it instead of him.

4119
03:51:35.006 --> 03:51:37.967
Let one out there, didn't I?

4120
03:51:41.888 --> 03:51:42.514
I'll always

4121
03:51:42.515 --> 03:51:45.433
Cherish this, I get to go to my death

4122
03:51:45.809 --> 03:51:49.853
as being one of only a handful
of people who've ever killed

4123
03:51:49.854 --> 03:51:51.898
Arnold Schwarzenegger on screen.

4124
03:51:56.194 --> 03:51:59.196
Running man was more to show how sick

4125
03:51:59.197 --> 03:52:03.742
I think we, a society,
can actually stoop to.

4126
03:52:03.743 --> 03:52:06.037
Entertainment knows no boundaries.

4127
03:52:06.454 --> 03:52:10.416
We don't give a damn what it is
as long as we get entertained by it

4128
03:52:10.417 --> 03:52:15.003
in the end, a pretty sick thing
to have sitting in our systems,

4129
03:52:15.004 --> 03:52:15.839
isn't it?

4130
03:52:15.880 --> 03:52:17.841
I'll be back.

4131
03:52:17.882 --> 03:52:19.884
Only in a rerun.

4132
03:52:26.724 --> 03:52:29.476
We all know that the
hero's journey is fundamentally

4133
03:52:29.477 --> 03:52:34.314
a part of many stories and science
fiction, usually a single character

4134
03:52:34.315 --> 03:52:39.319
who is initiating some adventure,
some call to action,

4135
03:52:39.320 --> 03:52:43.867
and that there is this
tremendous transformation.

4136
03:52:43.908 --> 03:52:47.871
Father! The sleeper has awaken!

4137
03:52:49.706 --> 03:52:50.831
Where do I come from?

4138
03:52:50.832 --> 03:52:52.291
Why do I matter?

4139
03:52:52.292 --> 03:52:55.169
What can I do to contribute
to the universe

4140
03:52:55.170 --> 03:52:59.048
in a real, meaningful way?
When we connect to heroes,

4141
03:52:59.466 --> 03:53:01.468
those are our idea! Selves.

4142
03:53:03.511 --> 03:53:05.972
Flash Gordon, he's just a guy

4143
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:09.057
he doesn't have any superpowers,

4144
03:53:09.058 --> 03:53:12.228
relies solely on his wit
and his athleticism.

4145
03:53:14.230 --> 03:53:15.439
They carry attributes

4146
03:53:15.440 --> 03:53:18.318
and features that we
want to see in ourselves.

4147
03:53:18.526 --> 03:53:23.697
Brave, courageous, taking risks,
being compassionate, being vulnerable,

4148
03:53:23.698 --> 03:53:28.703
intelligent. When we're in these moments
with these characters

4149
03:53:28.786 --> 03:53:33.500
feeling the fear,
the phobia, the desperation,

4150
03:53:33.750 --> 03:53:36.336
sometimes even grief.

4151
03:53:36.377 --> 03:53:38.379
Why not make me an author?

4152
03:53:39.214 --> 03:53:41.173
We all need to see the hero

4153
03:53:41.174 --> 03:53:43.343
have those things to relate to them.

4154
03:53:44.886 --> 03:53:47.847
Alex is essentially a very reluctant hero.

4155
03:53:47.889 --> 03:53:50.850
I mean, I would say a coward, really.

4156
03:53:50.892 --> 03:53:52.852
There's been a big mistake.

4157
03:53:52.894 --> 03:53:55.312
Am I to understand you're actually
declining the honor

4158
03:53:55.313 --> 03:53:56.707
- of being a starfighter?
- You got it.

4159
03:53:56.731 --> 03:53:58.358
What are you a coward?

4160
03:53:58.399 --> 03:53:58.816
Are you a coward?

4161
03:53:58.858 --> 03:54:00.150
Which I found very believable.

4162
03:54:00.151 --> 03:54:03.153
We also come to learn
that heroic actions do

4163
03:54:03.154 --> 03:54:07.742
not have to be huge,
extraordinary broad things,

4164
03:54:08.159 --> 03:54:12.205
they can be small,
very meaningful actions.

4165
03:54:12.247 --> 03:54:15.833
It is illogical for you to perform
this energy pack transplant. Oy.

4166
03:54:17.293 --> 03:54:19.169
I like unsung heroes.

4167
03:54:19.170 --> 03:54:21.839
I like the people who
nobody ever talks about.

4168
03:54:22.882 --> 03:54:26.761
Hold him in the security tower.
Keep it quiet. Move.

4169
03:54:28.346 --> 03:54:32.475
If you boil down the classics
as we know them, empire strikes back,

4170
03:54:32.600 --> 03:54:38.606
et, the Terminator,
what unites them all is humanity.

4171
03:54:39.065 --> 03:54:43.444
And is the way that the directors
and the writers create character

4172
03:54:43.861 --> 03:54:45.655
that's accessible.

4173
03:54:45.697 --> 03:54:48.074
When you're gotten past the energy
shield, proceed directly

4174
03:54:48.116 --> 03:54:48.658
to the randevue point.

4175
03:54:48.700 --> 03:54:51.327
Women like Princess Leia,

4176
03:54:51.452 --> 03:54:54.581
like vasquez, like Sarah Connor.

4177
03:54:56.082 --> 03:54:57.708
They're empowered.

4178
03:54:57.709 --> 03:54:59.836
They make decisions
that other people don't like.

4179
03:55:00.128 --> 03:55:02.297
They take initiative, they take control.

4180
03:55:02.338 --> 03:55:04.340
You're terminated, fucker.

4181
03:55:07.051 --> 03:55:10.930
We needed to have that as young women.

4182
03:55:13.224 --> 03:55:17.228
Lewis, I received so much
mail from young girls

4183
03:55:17.562 --> 03:55:20.523
that just loved this character.

4184
03:55:21.649 --> 03:55:25.403
I made them feel powerful.

4185
03:55:27.071 --> 03:55:29.490
You just stay away from me, bishop.
You got that straight?

4186
03:55:29.532 --> 03:55:31.325
These are characters

4187
03:55:31.326 --> 03:55:34.245
that the audience can relate to.

4188
03:55:34.912 --> 03:55:39.792
It was very encouraging for young girls
that they could accomplish

4189
03:55:40.501 --> 03:55:45.006
these things that may traditionally
have been left to the guys to do.

4190
03:55:48.217 --> 03:55:50.385
Many of us are drawn to the anti-hero.

4191
03:55:50.386 --> 03:55:55.266
There are aspects within them
that maybe fulfill some of our desires.

4192
03:55:55.516 --> 03:55:59.520
This concept of rule
breaking and nonconformity.

4193
03:55:59.562 --> 03:56:02.023
I have come here to chew
bubble gum and kick ass.

4194
03:56:04.025 --> 03:56:05.275
Something snarly

4195
03:56:05.276 --> 03:56:08.445
about those characters
that anti-establishment.

4196
03:56:08.446 --> 03:56:11.032
It's a different attitude.

4197
03:56:11.074 --> 03:56:11.824
Yes, I bet you have.

4198
03:56:11.866 --> 03:56:14.285
If we think about han, Max.

4199
03:56:14.327 --> 03:56:15.953
I'm just here for the gasoline.

4200
03:56:15.995 --> 03:56:16.954
Snake.

4201
03:56:16.996 --> 03:56:18.414
Get a new president.

4202
03:56:18.456 --> 03:56:22.793
Selfishness is there,
that sense of wanting to do

4203
03:56:22.794 --> 03:56:25.045
what's best for them is there.

4204
03:56:25.046 --> 03:56:28.757
And yet somewhere
in that rugged individuality,

4205
03:56:28.758 --> 03:56:32.637
somewhere in that stubbornness is a heart.

4206
03:56:32.679 --> 03:56:36.641
I'll chase him down the moons
of nibia and 'round the antares

4207
03:56:38.768 --> 03:56:42.897
maelstrom and 'round perdition's
flames before I give him up.

4208
03:56:43.314 --> 03:56:45.942
We connect to so many villains.

4209
03:56:46.275 --> 03:56:49.696
They're fascinating,
they're alluring, they're different.

4210
03:56:50.029 --> 03:56:52.615
I'm supposed to hate
or despise the villain,

4211
03:56:52.782 --> 03:56:55.827
but I actually feel connected
to them. Why?

4212
03:56:55.868 --> 03:56:59.831
If only you could see what
I have seen with your eyes.

4213
03:57:00.832 --> 03:57:04.961
I had no idea of the power of ursa.

4214
03:57:05.002 --> 03:57:06.963
I have powers beyond
reason here.

4215
03:57:09.882 --> 03:57:12.176
There's a real outlet

4216
03:57:12.260 --> 03:57:15.513
for bad behavior in these villains.

4217
03:57:15.847 --> 03:57:20.101
There's a vicarious indulgence
in rooting for the villain.

4218
03:57:20.143 --> 03:57:22.729
Ooh, guns, guns, guns!

4219
03:57:22.854 --> 03:57:23.354
And I think

4220
03:57:23.355 --> 03:57:28.401
that's a safe way to be close to evil,
destruction, bad behavior, and know,

4221
03:57:28.818 --> 03:57:32.113
that's ultimately not what I'm about at
the end of the day.

4222
03:57:32.822 --> 03:57:35.742
To be a good villain you had to
believe you were the good guy.

4223
03:57:36.451 --> 03:57:40.120
Once you believe you're the villain,
then suddenly you become stereotypical

4224
03:57:40.121 --> 03:57:42.498
of everything that everybody
wants a villain to be.

4225
03:57:42.540 --> 03:57:44.542
Take that program
to the holding pit!

4226
03:57:45.001 --> 03:57:46.126
Part of humanity

4227
03:57:46.127 --> 03:57:50.715
is acknowledging that we're not all good
and all perfect, that we have elements

4228
03:57:50.757 --> 03:57:53.551
of destruction, we make mistakes, that's

4229
03:57:53.926 --> 03:57:55.802
human psychology.

4230
03:57:55.803 --> 03:57:59.223
There will come a day when I'll
show all of you! Don't you forget it!

4231
03:58:00.391 --> 03:58:04.103
Seeing these characters overcome adversity

4232
03:58:04.437 --> 03:58:08.565
gives us really important suggestions
for our own lives

4233
03:58:08.566 --> 03:58:09.192
and our own behaviors.

4234
03:58:09.193 --> 03:58:11.194
No, biff. You leave her alone.

4235
03:58:12.528 --> 03:58:12.945
You leave her alone.

4236
03:58:12.987 --> 03:58:13.946
Is there anything

4237
03:58:13.947 --> 03:58:17.616
from this narrative that I feel inspired
by, that maybe I could do.

4238
03:58:17.617 --> 03:58:22.622
And what is it like to overcome
something that seems insurmountable?

4239
03:58:42.266 --> 03:58:44.268
I don't want you to think
earth girls are easy.

4240
03:58:44.811 --> 03:58:46.813
Earth girls are easy

4241
03:58:48.314 --> 03:58:49.439
earth girls are easy

4242
03:58:49.440 --> 03:58:51.859
was like an mtv musical.

4243
03:58:57.448 --> 03:58:58.615
It is a provocative title,

4244
03:58:58.616 --> 03:59:03.704
but the idea is that girls are complex
and you have to be open to changing

4245
03:59:03.996 --> 03:59:07.917
what you think is going to make you happy.

4246
03:59:08.125 --> 03:59:11.128
I need surprises.
I need romance.

4247
03:59:11.170 --> 03:59:12.547
I mean, how long has it been

4248
03:59:12.588 --> 03:59:13.464
since you said, "I love you"...

4249
03:59:13.506 --> 03:59:15.633
The original original idea came from -

4250
03:59:15.842 --> 03:59:17.969
you remember those
national enquirer stories?

4251
03:59:18.427 --> 03:59:22.139
I saw one where this woman said
an alien came in through the doggy door

4252
03:59:22.265 --> 03:59:24.684
and she had sex with him.

4253
03:59:25.893 --> 03:59:29.188
We thought that was hilarious.

4254
03:59:29.230 --> 03:59:31.190
Hey, come on everybody!
We're doing a makeover.

4255
03:59:33.985 --> 03:59:36.612
I thought the whole thing
should be a break into song musical.

4256
03:59:37.655 --> 03:59:40.825
Charlie coffey, my writing partner
and I, we proceeded to write,

4257
03:59:41.158 --> 03:59:44.912
I don't know, 25 drafts,
the reality of it was much different

4258
03:59:45.246 --> 03:59:47.122
when they finally landed on Julien temple,

4259
03:59:47.123 --> 03:59:51.419
they sent me his movie absolute beginners
to break into song musical.

4260
03:59:57.967 --> 04:00:00.219
So I thought, oh my god, this is perfect.

4261
04:00:00.428 --> 04:00:04.222
Once Julien got attached,
they realized the budget was going to be

4262
04:00:04.223 --> 04:00:09.937
this certain amount, and I wasn't
a big enough name to warrant that amount.

4263
04:00:10.146 --> 04:00:13.816
So I went in
and pitched me as the second lead.

4264
04:00:14.025 --> 04:00:17.945
And they went for it, but I was like,
so freaking

4265
04:00:18.321 --> 04:00:21.490
depressed about it and angry.

4266
04:00:21.657 --> 04:00:23.701
I've had to come to terms
with earth girls.

4267
04:00:25.453 --> 04:00:28.331
Geena Davis and Jeff goldblum,
they're both really nice.

4268
04:00:28.372 --> 04:00:30.498
It came as a package deal.

4269
04:00:30.499 --> 04:00:34.044
They were so in love
and they were making out on the set

4270
04:00:34.045 --> 04:00:37.048
all the time, and I found it irritating

4271
04:00:37.256 --> 04:00:40.759
because I was like, "this is my movie.

4272
04:00:40.760 --> 04:00:43.930
We must take this seriously."

4273
04:00:49.894 --> 04:00:50.728
The aliens,

4274
04:00:50.729 --> 04:00:55.066
we thought it would be really funny if
they were hairy when they first showed up.

4275
04:01:00.696 --> 04:01:02.949
Not recognizable as cute boys.

4276
04:01:03.574 --> 04:01:05.576
Shit, Valerie! Those are aliens!

4277
04:01:09.080 --> 04:01:13.042
And that there'd be this transformation.

4278
04:01:13.459 --> 04:01:15.461
Wow!

4279
04:01:15.503 --> 04:01:17.295
When they suggested Jim carrey

4280
04:01:17.296 --> 04:01:20.383
to me, for whitlock,
it was the craziest of the aliens.

4281
04:01:21.133 --> 04:01:25.011
He has this like not quite human quality

4282
04:01:25.012 --> 04:01:26.930
that he does on stage.

4283
04:01:26.931 --> 04:01:29.934
You won't be seeing much
more physical humor on my show.

4284
04:01:33.938 --> 04:01:35.730
There was a big search for that part.

4285
04:01:35.731 --> 04:01:38.025
I mean, I feel like
we're very lucky that he did it.

4286
04:01:38.859 --> 04:01:40.861
I'm going home with him.

4287
04:01:42.655 --> 04:01:44.657
Bitch.

4288
04:01:44.699 --> 04:01:46.324
Damon wayans is willing

4289
04:01:46.325 --> 04:01:50.037
to sort of do anything.

4290
04:01:50.913 --> 04:01:52.288
The aliens themselves

4291
04:01:52.289 --> 04:01:55.417
didn't have any kind of racism,

4292
04:01:55.418 --> 04:01:58.421
we thought that was very cool.

4293
04:01:59.463 --> 04:02:02.216
It very much captures '803

4294
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:06.011
valley specifically, and,
you know, they use the observatory

4295
04:02:06.012 --> 04:02:07.972
as the disco.

4296
04:02:10.683 --> 04:02:11.434
I would have loved

4297
04:02:11.435 --> 04:02:14.895
if there was more valley landmarks
that were in there that are gone now.

4298
04:02:14.937 --> 04:02:17.982
It really has this time
capsule quality of the '80s.

4299
04:02:20.276 --> 04:02:21.860
Love comes in

4300
04:02:21.861 --> 04:02:25.489
many forms and many shapes, right,
and it could be an alien from space,

4301
04:02:25.698 --> 04:02:28.701
something that is very relevant
and means something to me,

4302
04:02:29.035 --> 04:02:31.829
especially with,
you know, all my gay friends.

4303
04:02:32.121 --> 04:02:34.373
The thing is, earth girls
really are not easy,

4304
04:02:34.582 --> 04:02:37.501
but if she just took her vision
and changed it a little,

4305
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:41.504
the perfect man did show up.

4306
04:02:41.505 --> 04:02:43.507
Sounds like you have two hearts.

4307
04:02:43.549 --> 04:02:46.052
- Yes. Don't you?
- No.

4308
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:59.231
Akira

4309
04:02:59.273 --> 04:03:02.151
a government experiment that creates

4310
04:03:02.359 --> 04:03:06.572
super humans who are so powerful
their thoughts can destroy

4311
04:03:06.822 --> 04:03:08.783
everything.

4312
04:03:10.993 --> 04:03:14.538
Akira in the late '803 was
one of the first Japanese

4313
04:03:14.872 --> 04:03:19.125
anime things that came to the states
that people started to appreciate

4314
04:03:19.126 --> 04:03:22.296
and realize
how big this stuff is in Japan.

4315
04:03:22.505 --> 04:03:24.548
Like, it's not just Saturday
morning cartoons.

4316
04:03:25.299 --> 04:03:27.217
It was a big, big movie.

4317
04:03:27.218 --> 04:03:29.512
I think Akira kind of opened
that door in america.

4318
04:03:31.806 --> 04:03:32.806
Before I was aware

4319
04:03:32.807 --> 04:03:35.850
of Akira, I was a fan of
Japanese animation,

4320
04:03:35.851 --> 04:03:39.855
I really loved battle of the planets
and macros and robotech.

4321
04:03:39.980 --> 04:03:42.566
These are all cartoons
I watched after school.

4322
04:03:42.900 --> 04:03:46.862
When I was at a convention
and I saw the artwork for Akira on a vhs,

4323
04:03:46.904 --> 04:03:49.156
I thought, wow, cool, a movie.

4324
04:03:51.367 --> 04:03:53.702
And we put it in and what we had

4325
04:03:53.994 --> 04:03:56.997
was a third or fourth generation bootleg.

4326
04:03:57.748 --> 04:04:00.083
And it was all in Japanese.

4327
04:04:00.084 --> 04:04:02.169
It was not subtitled or dubbed.

4328
04:04:02.461 --> 04:04:04.672
We had no idea what the story was.

4329
04:04:07.216 --> 04:04:09.343
The animation was so compelling.

4330
04:04:09.552 --> 04:04:12.554
We just knew that this was amazing
and earth shaking

4331
04:04:12.555 --> 04:04:14.765
and was unlike anything we had ever seen.

4332
04:04:17.560 --> 04:04:21.729
It's about tetsuo's friends
trying to save him,

4333
04:04:21.730 --> 04:04:24.942
even when they realize that the way to
save him is to destroy him.

4334
04:04:32.992 --> 04:04:34.951
I've only been to Tokyo once,

4335
04:04:34.952 --> 04:04:39.206
and my oven/vhelming impression of it
was that Tokyo is just on top of you.

4336
04:04:39.248 --> 04:04:41.667
You can't move. In Neo Tokyo,

4337
04:04:41.709 --> 04:04:43.084
they've rebuilt Tokyo

4338
04:04:43.085 --> 04:04:46.755
and actually expanded some of the highways
and giving it more space.

4339
04:04:47.882 --> 04:04:52.094
Akira is the very first time I ever saw
one of those shots,

4340
04:04:52.303 --> 04:04:55.889
incredible motorbike coming at you
and starting that power slide

4341
04:04:55.890 --> 04:04:58.142
like what seems like
hundreds of feet away.

4342
04:04:59.977 --> 04:05:01.394
It's the visual Wilhelm scream

4343
04:05:01.395 --> 04:05:04.647
of anime,
it has to be in every anime,

4344
04:05:04.648 --> 04:05:08.694
and all of that was hand
animated and hand painted.

4345
04:05:09.445 --> 04:05:13.032
That was just jaw dropping to me.

4346
04:05:18.662 --> 04:05:21.207
I finally did see Akira in English,

4347
04:05:21.332 --> 04:05:24.585
and it's even better than what
I thought it was as a kid.

4348
04:05:36.513 --> 04:05:39.015
Hi, kids! It's me,
Ronald McDonald.

4349
04:05:39.016 --> 04:05:42.311
And I'm on the set of my
very first motion picture ever.

4350
04:05:42.353 --> 04:05:44.271
It's a movie called Mac and me.

4351
04:05:44.313 --> 04:05:47.107
Mac and me is the kirkland e.T.

4352
04:05:48.442 --> 04:05:49.276
There is an entire

4353
04:05:49.277 --> 04:05:52.947
generation of people
who only know Mac and me

4354
04:05:53.197 --> 04:05:57.033
because Paul rudd shows a
scene from Mac and me

4355
04:05:57.034 --> 04:06:00.204
on conan o'brien every time he goes
there to promote a movie.

4356
04:06:00.496 --> 04:06:04.333
I get a phone call and it's the guy
that I've never met.

4357
04:06:05.125 --> 04:06:09.755
And he said, "I have a film
that I want you to direct and write.

4358
04:06:09.964 --> 04:06:15.552
It's a lot like e.T., but I want to do it
with a family with an actual person

4359
04:06:15.636 --> 04:06:19.098
with a spinal bifida condition."

4360
04:06:20.933 --> 04:06:22.600
We didn't steal anything from him,

4361
04:06:22.601 --> 04:06:26.480
it was just a concept
to have an alien creature,

4362
04:06:26.730 --> 04:06:30.900
so I need the prototype aliens,
big big eyes, nothing like e.T.

4363
04:06:30.901 --> 04:06:33.028
And animated and cute.

4364
04:06:33.320 --> 04:06:34.737
It's the kids.

4365
04:06:34.738 --> 04:06:36.740
Can we go there and watch?

4366
04:06:36.782 --> 04:06:37.074
No way!

4367
04:06:37.116 --> 04:06:39.158
The lead boy, Jade calegory,

4368
04:06:39.159 --> 04:06:44.081
he was exactly what we want, and he could
act and he was wonderful in the movie.

4369
04:06:44.123 --> 04:06:46.125
Please? I won't anybody
hurt you.

4370
04:06:49.795 --> 04:06:50.754
It was fun to make

4371
04:06:50.755 --> 04:06:55.426
the film, but it was extremely limiting
because the creature

4372
04:06:55.509 --> 04:06:58.220
is really a puppet on cables.

4373
04:06:58.846 --> 04:07:01.682
Everything was time consuming,

4374
04:07:01.890 --> 04:07:03.642
but it worked.

4375
04:07:05.644 --> 04:07:08.647
He's so wholesome in his element.

4376
04:07:09.148 --> 04:07:12.066
They were both very cute together.

4377
04:07:12.067 --> 04:07:15.112
But it's all done
on the level of children.

4378
04:07:15.654 --> 04:07:18.574
It's a whole different world
when you're writing for kids.

4379
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:24.495
It was a charitable endeavor.

4380
04:07:24.496 --> 04:07:27.165
The producer is a man
that worked for McDonald's,

4381
04:07:27.166 --> 04:07:30.586
who is this big, main supplier,
a multimillionaire.

4382
04:07:30.836 --> 04:07:35.090
He was probably,
you know, polishing his own look

4383
04:07:35.424 --> 04:07:39.219
by making a film and giving
all of the money to this company.

4384
04:07:40.804 --> 04:07:42.513
Everything is a deal

4385
04:07:42.514 --> 04:07:45.976
behind films because films just cost
way too much money to make.

4386
04:07:47.061 --> 04:07:49.937
Well, the Ronald McDonald
actor in the film

4387
04:07:49.938 --> 04:07:53.525
was the one that was actually on TV
in all the commercials.

4388
04:07:54.026 --> 04:07:55.861
It was a crossover of perfection.

4389
04:07:59.656 --> 04:08:01.992
We have this building that
they're giving us.

4390
04:08:02.409 --> 04:08:05.079
We have as many dances
as we can put in there.

4391
04:08:05.371 --> 04:08:07.873
That's how it was created.

4392
04:08:09.124 --> 04:08:10.375
One of the dancers

4393
04:08:10.376 --> 04:08:13.754
in that background,
which we shot was Jennifer Aniston.

4394
04:08:14.171 --> 04:08:15.964
Can you believe that?

4395
04:08:17.841 --> 04:08:21.178
Nobody paid tribute to this producer

4396
04:08:21.637 --> 04:08:26.475
than made a whole movie
to help people who were handicapped

4397
04:08:26.725 --> 04:08:30.270
have more presence in the film business,
and it destroyed the kid.

4398
04:08:30.354 --> 04:08:33.774
He did it because he wanted to show
the people that couldn't move

4399
04:08:33.899 --> 04:08:36.610
except in a wheelchair
could do all this stuff.

4400
04:08:37.319 --> 04:08:41.073
So then Paul rudd comes along
and he sticks out this whole scene

4401
04:08:41.615 --> 04:08:45.076
with Jade losing control of his wheelchair

4402
04:08:45.077 --> 04:08:47.454
and flying off a cliff.

4403
04:08:52.167 --> 04:08:52.876
He did it

4404
04:08:52.918 --> 04:08:56.713
year after year after year, he is single

4405
04:08:56.755 --> 04:08:59.341
handedly kept that movie alive.

4406
04:08:59.758 --> 04:09:04.137
I would love to sit down with him
and write a sequel

4407
04:09:04.138 --> 04:09:07.683
to that movie with him
starring in it with this creature.

4408
04:09:08.725 --> 04:09:09.685
My wife's always saying

4409
04:09:09.686 --> 04:09:11.603
we should call Paul rudd.

4410
04:09:22.948 --> 04:09:27.703
Sometimes science fiction
holds an obligation

4411
04:09:28.328 --> 04:09:31.957
to give messages and even commentary

4412
04:09:32.207 --> 04:09:36.128
about our social systems.

4413
04:09:36.170 --> 04:09:38.172
Alien nation

4414
04:09:38.213 --> 04:09:39.923
alien nation was tackling

4415
04:09:39.965 --> 04:09:42.301
themes of racism and segregation.

4416
04:09:42.342 --> 04:09:45.721
At least I'm a detective,
not some outer shit space thing.

4417
04:09:45.804 --> 04:09:48.765
Not very subtle metaphor.

4418
04:09:48.807 --> 04:09:50.767
Their ship was a slave ship,

4419
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:52.954
washed ashore on earth with no way
to get back to where they came from.

4420
04:09:52.978 --> 04:09:55.772
There are immigrants
who have ended up in la.

4421
04:09:56.190 --> 04:09:58.608
A lot of the time doing the menial jobs.

4422
04:09:58.609 --> 04:10:00.735
So it's a kind of it's
a look at the way L.A.

4423
04:10:00.736 --> 04:10:01.945
Works.

4424
04:10:02.905 --> 04:10:06.491
Alien nation is basically
a science fiction

4425
04:10:06.492 --> 04:10:09.076
version of a buddy cop movie.

4426
04:10:09.077 --> 04:10:10.787
Change your mind?

4427
04:10:10.829 --> 04:10:13.039
Two mismatched cops
come together to solve a crime,

4428
04:10:13.040 --> 04:10:15.209
well known trope
by this point in the '803.

4429
04:10:15.250 --> 04:10:17.252
Hey, nice signal dickhead!

4430
04:10:17.878 --> 04:10:18.504
The film stars

4431
04:10:18.505 --> 04:10:22.423
James caan as the human cop,
Matt Sykes and Mandy patinkin

4432
04:10:22.424 --> 04:10:24.843
as his alien counterpart,
George Francisco.

4433
04:10:24.885 --> 04:10:26.845
My true name is stangya-sorenz-ahhhh.
Sorenz-ah,

4434
04:10:28.680 --> 04:10:30.598
- well, gesundheit. Ha.
- Thank you.

4435
04:10:30.599 --> 04:10:31.475
I'll call you George.

4436
04:10:31.517 --> 04:10:34.435
Terence stamp plays
the newcomer, the villain in the film.

4437
04:10:34.436 --> 04:10:36.939
You move one finger and
you're history, you hear me?

4438
04:10:36.980 --> 04:10:38.982
Not history. Eternity!

4439
04:10:41.151 --> 04:10:42.193
Gale Anne hurd.

4440
04:10:42.194 --> 04:10:46.532
She didn't want to be seen just as James
Cameron's producer, she wanted to say,

4441
04:10:46.615 --> 04:10:50.452
actually, I do my own things.
And that's where alien nation comes in.

4442
04:10:50.702 --> 04:10:54.539
It has the feel of the Terminator,
it has a feel of that

4443
04:10:54.540 --> 04:10:57.751
look the way that Cameron
went about science fiction.

4444
04:10:58.961 --> 04:11:00.963
Where's the drug?

4445
04:11:01.046 --> 04:11:04.215
Bring the science to the contemporary.

4446
04:11:04.216 --> 04:11:07.385
Bring it to the current city
and that idea that Los Angeles

4447
04:11:07.386 --> 04:11:10.305
is an essential character
in the whole piece.

4448
04:11:12.099 --> 04:11:16.727
Initially, when Stan Winston
and his team got that job,

4449
04:11:16.728 --> 04:11:20.816
they were hoping to make the aliens
a little less humanoid.

4450
04:11:20.983 --> 04:11:22.650
Some of his team were looking at the

4451
04:11:22.651 --> 04:11:26.488
Louis gossett junior character in enemy
mine as inspiration for where they could go

4452
04:11:26.655 --> 04:11:30.408
but in the end, and I believe wisely so,
the filmmakers said, no,

4453
04:11:30.409 --> 04:11:34.746
we want them to be closer to human
to really play up that theme of

4454
04:11:34.997 --> 04:11:36.664
we're similar in the end, right?

4455
04:11:36.665 --> 04:11:37.874
So why these differences?

4456
04:11:37.916 --> 04:11:41.002
Yeah, I mean, it's made ofr rubber,
it's stretches, right?

4457
04:11:41.003 --> 04:11:43.005
And still it fits?

4458
04:11:43.839 --> 04:11:46.133
This genre has always

4459
04:11:46.300 --> 04:11:53.140
been about the expansion of our ideas
and how we relate to one another.

4460
04:11:53.348 --> 04:11:56.350
Our social elements, our
social structure, even elements

4461
04:11:56.351 --> 04:12:01.063
that we should be more mindful of
and even dismantle.

4462
04:12:01.064 --> 04:12:03.608
So why do we have to take them?
Why can't they go to Russia

4463
04:12:03.609 --> 04:12:06.028
- or some place like that.
- I'll drink to that.

4464
04:12:06.111 --> 04:12:07.153
Alien nation

4465
04:12:07.154 --> 04:12:10.115
thrived later, when it was
redeveloped for television.

4466
04:12:10.657 --> 04:12:13.993
That's when the themes that we talk about
are in your face every week,

4467
04:12:13.994 --> 04:12:17.204
and the show becomes an allegory
for all of these topical stories

4468
04:12:17.205 --> 04:12:19.916
that are still resonating today.

4469
04:12:30.385 --> 04:12:33.889
Where do you go looking
for a cherry 2000?

4470
04:12:35.474 --> 04:12:39.185
A post-apocalyptic world
that has this kind of

4471
04:12:39.186 --> 04:12:43.440
technological utopia that is very similar
to what we find ourselves in today.

4472
04:12:43.482 --> 04:12:45.191
You know, everything's
kind of taken care of

4473
04:12:45.192 --> 04:12:49.362
and yet there's a whole undennorld
just barely getting by and getting by

4474
04:12:49.363 --> 04:12:53.533
in the most ingenious
and sort of violent and horrible ways.

4475
04:12:53.575 --> 04:12:55.577
- Where you're from, mister?
- Anaheim.

4476
04:13:00.332 --> 04:13:01.707
It really is

4477
04:13:01.708 --> 04:13:04.419
a little scary in
its visionary aspects.

4478
04:13:04.795 --> 04:13:08.465
Most of the world
has given up on relationships.

4479
04:13:08.674 --> 04:13:13.387
So if you had your domestic mate
at cherry 2000, which was the epitome

4480
04:13:13.804 --> 04:13:16.764
of what you would want,
you know, if it breaks, you can't get it

4481
04:13:16.765 --> 04:13:20.227
fixed in the current world,
so you have to go out into zone 7.

4482
04:13:21.353 --> 04:13:23.354
She's at cherry 2000.

4483
04:13:23.355 --> 04:13:26.774
I want you to go into zone 7,
and give me one just like her.

4484
04:13:26.775 --> 04:13:29.903
A director just fell out,
I found out later it was Irv kershner,

4485
04:13:30.070 --> 04:13:32.781
and they were desperate
to get somebody and go shoot.

4486
04:13:33.490 --> 04:13:36.618
I read 20 pages
and it was brilliant, weird stuff,

4487
04:13:36.743 --> 04:13:39.287
so ijumped on cherry,
which was a moving train.

4488
04:13:41.581 --> 04:13:43.917
Melanie Griffith, she just had a baby.

4489
04:13:43.959 --> 04:13:47.003
So it was a very tough shoot,
she really had to endure a lot.

4490
04:13:49.673 --> 04:13:52.925
There's a little easter egg in the robot
repair thing where

4491
04:13:52.926 --> 04:13:57.513
Sam treadwell, played by David
Andrews, goes to see a robot repair

4492
04:13:57.514 --> 04:14:01.892
guy, and I put robby the robot
in gort in there, at my expense,

4493
04:14:01.893 --> 04:14:05.980
it was out of my little director's
slush fund. Forbidden planet is

4494
04:14:05.981 --> 04:14:10.526
probably the first movie of the sci
fi genre that really influenced me.

4495
04:14:10.527 --> 04:14:12.529
So it was giving back to that.

4496
04:14:12.571 --> 04:14:15.532
I am monitored to respond
to the name roby.

4497
04:14:19.995 --> 04:14:23.165
We shot in every toxic location in Nevada

4498
04:14:23.498 --> 04:14:26.625
inside hoover dam, electromagnetic forces

4499
04:14:26.626 --> 04:14:30.714
in the spillways and radiation zones

4500
04:14:31.214 --> 04:14:33.717
concocted some crazy, over-the-top

4501
04:14:33.800 --> 04:14:36.261
rpg fights and things like that.

4502
04:14:37.262 --> 04:14:39.388
The one big set piece with the magnet

4503
04:14:39.389 --> 04:14:41.391
in the mustang.

4504
04:14:43.560 --> 04:14:45.604
You'd never do it today,
it would all be cgi.

4505
04:14:50.901 --> 04:14:51.942
It's a real stunt

4506
04:14:51.943 --> 04:14:55.447
woman hanging on to that
car out over hoover dam.

4507
04:14:55.947 --> 04:14:58.575
Thank god it was only one take.

4508
04:15:03.330 --> 04:15:06.750
Vegas buried in sand dunes, I think
that was the first time it was ever done.

4509
04:15:07.042 --> 04:15:10.712
We did old glass maps
where you actually paint

4510
04:15:10.962 --> 04:15:14.466
and shoot through them, built
big sets poking out of there.

4511
04:15:14.883 --> 04:15:17.718
The Vegas showgirls and all that.

4512
04:15:17.719 --> 04:15:21.764
Besides blowing up a lot of Nevada
in the process, it's really about love,

4513
04:15:21.765 --> 04:15:25.519
about finding true love,
not an idealized mate

4514
04:15:25.852 --> 04:15:28.230
that does your bidding
and cooks you dinner.

4515
04:15:28.313 --> 04:15:32.526
It's about interactions
with a tough, equal or superior woman.

4516
04:15:34.277 --> 04:15:36.571
And finally, realizing that that's

4517
04:15:36.738 --> 04:15:38.990
that's more desirable.

4518
04:15:48.583 --> 04:15:50.251
One of the aspects

4519
04:15:50.252 --> 04:15:54.296
of being a science fiction
fan was a fascination

4520
04:15:54.297 --> 04:15:59.135
with what science
can bring us in the world of tomorrow.

4521
04:15:59.553 --> 04:16:01.805
What might be? What could be?

4522
04:16:01.847 --> 04:16:05.141
Hello, I'm Johnny cab.

4523
04:16:05.225 --> 04:16:08.061
It is a forecast into our future.

4524
04:16:08.979 --> 04:16:11.230
A lot of science
fiction writers are writing

4525
04:16:11.231 --> 04:16:15.609
and developing technologies
that end up becoming real in the future.

4526
04:16:15.610 --> 04:16:19.281
People in the fields of medicine
and technology and science,

4527
04:16:19.573 --> 04:16:22.241
it's very exciting to know
that all of these people were inspired

4528
04:16:22.242 --> 04:16:23.910
by watching Star Trek.

4529
04:16:23.952 --> 04:16:25.012
Klingon mummification glyph.

4530
04:16:25.036 --> 04:16:27.622
What were the principal
historical events on the planet

4531
04:16:27.664 --> 04:16:28.290
earth in the year 1987? Correct.

4532
04:16:28.331 --> 04:16:29.456
Sci fi

4533
04:16:29.457 --> 04:16:32.085
imitates real life, real life
imitates sci fi.

4534
04:16:35.839 --> 04:16:36.798
We create

4535
04:16:36.799 --> 04:16:42.678
art through our movies and our stories
that is of our imagination,

4536
04:16:42.679 --> 04:16:45.682
and then someone somewhere goes, "hey, hey,

4537
04:16:46.224 --> 04:16:48.977
what if I could do that?"

4538
04:16:53.106 --> 04:16:55.274
You think of all the things

4539
04:16:55.275 --> 04:16:58.945
that were figments of
someone's imagination.

4540
04:16:59.029 --> 04:17:01.196
Motion trackers, who would have thunk?

4541
04:17:01.197 --> 04:17:05.076
And now we're almost reliant on GPS.

4542
04:17:05.118 --> 04:17:07.078
What about tracking?
We can check his exact

4543
04:17:07.120 --> 04:17:09.122
location at all times.

4544
04:17:09.164 --> 04:17:10.873
The phone, which is not a phone, it's

4545
04:17:10.874 --> 04:17:14.961
a phone, it's a camera, it's your day
runner, it has a tape measure.

4546
04:17:15.045 --> 04:17:17.422
It's everything. It's your entire life.

4547
04:17:17.631 --> 04:17:20.300
I never thought I'd be wearing a computer

4548
04:17:20.425 --> 04:17:22.886
on my wrist, it's just laughable.

4549
04:17:23.720 --> 04:17:26.388
There are computers in our iPhones
that are actually more powerful

4550
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:29.476
than the computer
that was in the Apollo missions, right?

4551
04:17:29.893 --> 04:17:32.145
Which is mind boggling.

4552
04:17:33.021 --> 04:17:36.148
In runaway, there was
that almost Internet

4553
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:38.777
before its time.

4554
04:17:41.529 --> 04:17:43.865
The drone technology.

4555
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:46.576
Police are preparing a floater
camera which will enter the house

4556
04:17:46.618 --> 04:17:48.721
in an attempt to locate
the runaway 912 and the infant.

4557
04:17:48.745 --> 04:17:49.537
All of that stuff

4558
04:17:49.538 --> 04:17:52.624
has pretty much come to life.

4559
04:17:52.832 --> 04:17:55.543
The science has caught up
to the science fiction.

4560
04:17:55.877 --> 04:18:00.714
There is more technological advance
in the past 50 years than there is

4561
04:18:00.715 --> 04:18:04.594
in all of recorded history up to 50 years
ago, and that will continue.

4562
04:18:07.180 --> 04:18:09.264
Arthur c. Clarke's definition

4563
04:18:09.265 --> 04:18:13.019
that any advanced technology
will be indistinguishable from magic.

4564
04:18:13.728 --> 04:18:17.065
What we think of today as impossible

4565
04:18:17.357 --> 04:18:20.401
and magical in 15 or 20 or even 1000

4566
04:18:20.402 --> 04:18:23.822
years will be commonplace.

4567
04:18:24.864 --> 04:18:27.450
We just don't know
what's around the corner.

4568
04:18:28.493 --> 04:18:31.454
And it's bound to be something
that will blow our minds right.

4569
04:18:31.997 --> 04:18:35.624
I would only hope that humankind
would continue to be inspired

4570
04:18:35.625 --> 04:18:38.545
by the possibilities of the future.

4571
04:18:39.504 --> 04:18:40.338
It's crazy.

4572
04:18:40.339 --> 04:18:42.464
I don't know where we're headed.

4573
04:18:42.465 --> 04:18:46.176
At some point, all of this stuff is going
to be implanted into our heads somewhere

4574
04:18:46.177 --> 04:18:49.305
and we'll just think something
and there it'll be in front of us.

4575
04:18:49.556 --> 04:18:50.473
Why not?

4576
04:18:50.474 --> 04:18:52.475
I would like to ask a quesiton.
Will I dream?

4577
04:18:52.517 --> 04:18:54.519
Of course you will dream.

4578
04:18:54.853 --> 04:18:58.356
Some of the things that have come to
fruition are very scary.

4579
04:18:58.398 --> 04:19:01.984
You know, when we talk about
facial recognition, deepfake technologies,

4580
04:19:01.985 --> 04:19:05.195
artificial intelligence that could
potentially take over the planet,

4581
04:19:05.196 --> 04:19:07.282
these are the kinds of things
that were forecast

4582
04:19:07.657 --> 04:19:11.036
in the '803 sci fi films
that are just now starting to break.

4583
04:19:14.080 --> 04:19:16.916
Deepfakes, this is an existential issue,

4584
04:19:17.417 --> 04:19:21.129
because we're going to come back to
the idea of, do you trust your fellow man?

4585
04:19:21.212 --> 04:19:23.506
It's not the deepfake
that's going to make the difference.

4586
04:19:23.757 --> 04:19:25.842
It's the guy behind the deepfake.

4587
04:19:25.884 --> 04:19:27.969
Right now, you don't even have
to do a deepfake.

4588
04:19:28.053 --> 04:19:32.557
Just tell the same lie over
and over and over again and you're in.

4589
04:19:32.599 --> 04:19:37.979
To me, that's the disturbing part,
not the ability to sing the siren song.

4590
04:19:38.146 --> 04:19:40.231
It's the people who are seduced by it.

4591
04:19:43.276 --> 04:19:45.152
We find ourselves now

4592
04:19:45.153 --> 04:19:48.947
in this somewhat
both inspiring and dystopian

4593
04:19:48.948 --> 04:19:52.243
future world that's very much
like the movies that we all watched.

4594
04:19:52.619 --> 04:19:55.371
Part of the nostalgia
for the '803 movies

4595
04:19:55.580 --> 04:19:58.416
is that they dealt with a lot of
these fears very, very well.

4596
04:19:58.541 --> 04:20:01.211
They dealt with government paranoia.

4597
04:20:01.586 --> 04:20:06.466
They dealt with technological overreach
and hyper innovation.

4598
04:20:11.221 --> 04:20:13.890
What are you really
sacrificing in the name of progress.

4599
04:20:14.432 --> 04:20:16.809
And, yeah, computers
are going to try to kill us.

4600
04:20:16.810 --> 04:20:20.313
And I think in some way
computers have tried to kill us.

4601
04:20:21.606 --> 04:20:24.943
We already live
within the construct of skynet.

4602
04:20:24.984 --> 04:20:26.569
If you're on any social media,

4603
04:20:26.611 --> 04:20:31.490
all of those systems are artificial
intelligence systems that are aggregating

4604
04:20:31.491 --> 04:20:35.203
all of those algorithms
and figuring out who you are

4605
04:20:35.245 --> 04:20:37.455
in a way that you don't even understand.

4606
04:20:37.497 --> 04:20:39.790
They cannot make things
like that yet.

4607
04:20:39.791 --> 04:20:40.750
Not yet.

4608
04:20:40.792 --> 04:20:42.835
Skynet in Terminator

4609
04:20:42.836 --> 04:20:46.548
was the warning,
and every time you input a piece of data,

4610
04:20:46.965 --> 04:20:49.801
you were adding to that quote
unquote skynet.

4611
04:20:49.843 --> 04:20:51.845
Enhance 34 to 36.

4612
04:20:54.097 --> 04:20:56.891
I think every generation looks
at the new technology.

4613
04:20:57.016 --> 04:21:00.854
There's the scariness and this hopefulness
that I think always coexist.

4614
04:21:00.979 --> 04:21:04.107
And so it comes down to do
we have systems in place

4615
04:21:04.357 --> 04:21:09.070
that allow us the beneficial
aspects of technology

4616
04:21:09.320 --> 04:21:12.574
while limiting the potential
for abuse and misuse.

4617
04:21:14.993 --> 04:21:15.702
I think that for

4618
04:21:15.703 --> 04:21:19.164
every new technology,
for every sci fi idea,

4619
04:21:19.581 --> 04:21:21.957
you can find a movie that's hopeful

4620
04:21:21.958 --> 04:21:24.127
about what that's going to
do to transform the world.

4621
04:21:24.335 --> 04:21:28.756
And a movie that's terrified about how
this thing is going to destroy everything.

4622
04:21:29.924 --> 04:21:32.759
There isn't a single sci
fi concept where you can't find

4623
04:21:32.760 --> 04:21:35.638
both of those kinds of movies.

4624
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:50.111
Bill & Ted's

4625
04:21:50.153 --> 04:21:52.155
excellent! Excellent!

4626
04:21:52.447 --> 04:21:53.781
Excellent adventure

4627
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:57.493
what if you had the ultimate power
of the gods in your hand

4628
04:21:57.785 --> 04:22:01.289
and yet you're such an imbecile
that you did

4629
04:22:01.831 --> 04:22:04.751
nothing with it, really.

4630
04:22:04.792 --> 04:22:07.879
All we are is dust
and the wind, dude.

4631
04:22:09.464 --> 04:22:12.050
It was so nice to see a script written

4632
04:22:12.634 --> 04:22:14.928
with young people who were still young.

4633
04:22:14.969 --> 04:22:16.971
We're wild stallions!

4634
04:22:18.181 --> 04:22:19.181
Who had innocence

4635
04:22:19.182 --> 04:22:23.227
and openness and weren't cynical and jaded
and weren't talking

4636
04:22:23.228 --> 04:22:25.563
like characters
out of a Woody Allen movie at 16.

4637
04:22:25.605 --> 04:22:28.274
How's it going, royal
ugly dudes?

4638
04:22:29.484 --> 04:22:32.069
The reason that Keanu and I
probably got hired was that

4639
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:37.242
we were both theater kids and we both took
the characters very seriously.

4640
04:22:43.414 --> 04:22:44.332
Really playing them with

4641
04:22:44.333 --> 04:22:47.377
sincerity and not with a wink
and a nod of the audience.

4642
04:22:48.461 --> 04:22:50.295
It's not back to the future.

4643
04:22:50.296 --> 04:22:52.297
You know, we're not that big.

4644
04:22:52.298 --> 04:22:56.385
We didn't have a lot of money, but
we really leaned into the kind of ragtag,

4645
04:22:56.386 --> 04:23:00.264
sincere analog nature of this hyper

4646
04:23:00.265 --> 04:23:03.977
real situation that we were in.

4647
04:23:04.018 --> 04:23:06.020
Hey! That's us.
We're back in San dimas!

4648
04:23:06.312 --> 04:23:09.315
Yeah. Only now it's not now.
It's last night.

4649
04:23:10.191 --> 04:23:13.277
My favorite scene from bill
and Ted is the circle k

4650
04:23:13.278 --> 04:23:16.364
when the phone booth arrives.

4651
04:23:16.406 --> 04:23:18.199
Not bad!

4652
04:23:18.241 --> 04:23:20.284
In terms of sci fi conceits,

4653
04:23:20.285 --> 04:23:22.412
acting opposite yourself was really fun.

4654
04:23:22.620 --> 04:23:25.915
Strange things are afoot
at the circle k.

4655
04:23:27.458 --> 04:23:28.625
Time travel.

4656
04:23:28.626 --> 04:23:32.171
Multiple versions of yourself.

4657
04:23:32.213 --> 04:23:35.591
- 69 dudes!
- Whoa.

4658
04:23:35.925 --> 04:23:37.301
That kind of mind screw

4659
04:23:37.302 --> 04:23:39.804
type stuff is the most fun.

4660
04:23:39.846 --> 04:23:41.848
Want a twinkie, genghis Khan?

4661
04:23:42.056 --> 04:23:45.268
Our film is a strange movie.

4662
04:23:45.310 --> 04:23:47.312
I'm darth Ted.

4663
04:23:48.021 --> 04:23:50.023
I'll never rule the universe with you!

4664
04:23:50.064 --> 04:23:51.606
We didn't have a Rufus for,

4665
04:23:51.607 --> 04:23:54.651
you know, it was well into production.

4666
04:23:54.652 --> 04:23:56.654
Greetings, my excellent friends.

4667
04:23:56.696 --> 04:23:58.698
I'm here to help you
with your history report.

4668
04:23:58.823 --> 04:24:01.867
They kept throwing names at us,
and they went after Connery,

4669
04:24:01.868 --> 04:24:04.244
I think with the time bandits thing,

4670
04:24:04.245 --> 04:24:07.581
Keanu and I were actually
genuinely worried that they were going

4671
04:24:07.582 --> 04:24:10.585
to cast the wrong Rufus, but
we were really, really lucky with carlin.

4672
04:24:14.255 --> 04:24:17.300
I'm not strict about time travel rules,
I just want to be entertained.

4673
04:24:17.383 --> 04:24:20.053
The time travel mechanics
are actually very, very tight

4674
04:24:20.428 --> 04:24:23.723
and very, very realistic.

4675
04:24:23.765 --> 04:24:26.493
We'll time travel back to two days ago,
steal your dad's keys and leave them here!

4676
04:24:26.517 --> 04:24:29.394
My favorite time travel
mechanic is when bill and Ted decide

4677
04:24:29.395 --> 04:24:32.690
that they're going to do a thing
in the future using the time machine.

4678
04:24:32.732 --> 04:24:34.692
W see? Ow, yeah!

4679
04:24:35.818 --> 04:24:37.152
That's the ultimate sort of closed

4680
04:24:37.153 --> 04:24:39.364
loop time travel mechanic.

4681
04:24:39.405 --> 04:24:41.699
We can't forget to do this,
othennise it won't happen.

4682
04:24:41.741 --> 04:24:43.284
But it did happen!

4683
04:24:43.326 --> 04:24:44.743
It really could have gone off the rails

4684
04:24:44.744 --> 04:24:48.581
at any point along the way.

4685
04:24:48.623 --> 04:24:50.625
We're history.

4686
04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:54.170
For all of the circuits of time stuff,
they just had a boot that was like a canoe

4687
04:24:54.379 --> 04:24:59.217
just kind of wedged onto the top
of like this really rickety hydraulic pole

4688
04:24:59.675 --> 04:25:03.428
that was very high in the air
and like a shoddy sound stage

4689
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:05.097
outside of phenix somewhere.

4690
04:25:05.098 --> 04:25:06.849
125 degrees.

4691
04:25:06.891 --> 04:25:09.018
Sweating profusely all the time.

4692
04:25:09.185 --> 04:25:12.646
Everyone just stinking to high heaven
looks like a bad carny ride.

4693
04:25:12.647 --> 04:25:17.318
And it's like going... jerking around,
you know, certain we were going to die.

4694
04:25:21.197 --> 04:25:23.574
The movie got shelved,
so it came out a full year later.

4695
04:25:23.616 --> 04:25:27.662
I'd written it off as having any success,
and then it just exploded.

4696
04:25:29.205 --> 04:25:31.832
When you're in a film that punctures
pop culture like that, there's

4697
04:25:31.833 --> 04:25:35.169
really no way to be prepared for it
because it is very surreal.

4698
04:25:35.211 --> 04:25:37.213
Party on, dudes!

4699
04:25:44.178 --> 04:25:46.888
I think the what if genre
is definitely a sci fi genre

4700
04:25:46.889 --> 04:25:51.602
and there is a sci fi veneer to anything
about bombs going off, like nuclear war.

4701
04:25:51.644 --> 04:25:55.106
It definitely falls into the
sci fi category, at least

4702
04:25:55.857 --> 04:25:57.899
until it happens.

4703
04:25:57.900 --> 04:25:59.902
Miracle mile

4704
04:25:59.944 --> 04:26:02.447
listen, I'm just a guy, who-who
picked up the phone.

4705
04:26:04.782 --> 04:26:06.283
It was a famous script.

4706
04:26:06.284 --> 04:26:09.494
Everybody's talked about this script.

4707
04:26:09.495 --> 04:26:13.207
It's an audacious movie made for,
I think, a 1.98 at night.

4708
04:26:13.541 --> 04:26:17.086
To me, it was like early Spielberg.

4709
04:26:17.128 --> 04:26:19.129
This can't be true.

4710
04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:20.298
It can't.

4711
04:26:20.339 --> 04:26:21.548
What would you do

4712
04:26:21.549 --> 04:26:26.012
if you were the only person to know
that you have 70 minutes to live?

4713
04:26:28.055 --> 04:26:29.139
The rube goldberg

4714
04:26:29.140 --> 04:26:32.602
thing in miracle mile
is that he decides to quit smoking,

4715
04:26:33.019 --> 04:26:36.063
so he throws his cigarette down
and a pigeon picks it up.

4716
04:26:36.564 --> 04:26:40.567
He lays down to take a nap
to meet his newfound love at midnight,

4717
04:26:40.568 --> 04:26:43.654
and the power goes off
in these three hours late.

4718
04:26:44.197 --> 04:26:46.198
You just missed her.

4719
04:26:46.199 --> 04:26:48.910
My alarm didn't go off. And the
power went out in the hotel.

4720
04:26:50.495 --> 04:26:52.329
This movie really starts going

4721
04:26:52.330 --> 04:26:54.373
when the phone rings.

4722
04:26:56.209 --> 04:26:58.210
What exactly are you
talking about?

4723
04:26:58.211 --> 04:27:01.005
I'm talking about nuclear
fucking war!

4724
04:27:01.047 --> 04:27:01.672
Who is this?

4725
04:27:01.714 --> 04:27:04.841
What would you do
if you accidentally got that phone call

4726
04:27:04.842 --> 04:27:09.430
and you just know that it's coming? By
getting people to really think about that

4727
04:27:09.555 --> 04:27:13.184
and reflect on it, it affects decision
making in the real world.

4728
04:27:14.685 --> 04:27:17.979
It's always walking that tightrope of
is this happening?

4729
04:27:17.980 --> 04:27:19.607
Am I crazy?

4730
04:27:19.649 --> 04:27:21.609
So he was calling from
a missile silo.

4731
04:27:21.651 --> 04:27:24.946
He said that they were
locked in! 50 minutes and counting.

4732
04:27:25.029 --> 04:27:27.490
The real time when the clock started

4733
04:27:27.865 --> 04:27:30.618
counting down, it's a fabulous convention.

4734
04:27:30.660 --> 04:27:32.620
Condoms! We won't
be needing these.

4735
04:27:32.662 --> 04:27:34.455
We got to repopulate
the whole planet.

4736
04:27:34.497 --> 04:27:35.456
The interesting thing

4737
04:27:35.457 --> 04:27:39.377
was the odd people in it
and the love story within it.

4738
04:27:39.418 --> 04:27:41.419
Trust me with this!

4739
04:27:41.420 --> 04:27:43.422
With what?

4740
04:27:43.464 --> 04:27:45.466
I love you.

4741
04:27:46.133 --> 04:27:50.595
By the end, it's sort of one of the
iconic images, this river of cars

4742
04:27:50.596 --> 04:27:52.723
and human chaos.

4743
04:27:55.226 --> 04:27:56.601
It was pretty crazy

4744
04:27:56.602 --> 04:28:00.273
for us to do that on this low budget.

4745
04:28:00.815 --> 04:28:03.317
I'm shot and fall, my face
falls, and I'm like, "great.

4746
04:28:03.359 --> 04:28:05.736
That's my hitchcockian cameo."

4747
04:28:07.863 --> 04:28:11.409
It was $3 million to make this movie,
which even in the '803,

4748
04:28:11.534 --> 04:28:13.828
I don't know how we did it.

4749
04:28:14.912 --> 04:28:17.415
You tell me now!
You joking, ha?!

4750
04:28:17.540 --> 04:28:20.710
I was in danger of being fired
every day of the shoot

4751
04:28:21.043 --> 04:28:24.171
because they said it was impossible to do.

4752
04:28:25.840 --> 04:28:28.301
Warner brothers offered a fortune.

4753
04:28:28.634 --> 04:28:33.013
They said if we thought about making
miracle mile as a single story twilight

4754
04:28:33.014 --> 04:28:34.014
zone.

4755
04:28:34.807 --> 04:28:38.561
The only change they wanted to make
was he woke up and it was all a dream

4756
04:28:38.894 --> 04:28:44.025
and then started happening again,
which would just not satisfy anybody.

4757
04:28:44.066 --> 04:28:47.737
It's total chaos! The fear,
it's total, absolute...

4758
04:28:47.903 --> 04:28:48.863
I didn't want to do

4759
04:28:48.864 --> 04:28:51.324
anything that gave you hope,
I hate to say it.

4760
04:28:51.907 --> 04:28:53.283
I wanted to shake people up.

4761
04:28:53.284 --> 04:28:56.995
I wanted to have them walk
out of the theater and go do something

4762
04:28:56.996 --> 04:28:58.914
about the issue.

4763
04:29:00.124 --> 04:29:02.334
It could happen more likely tonight

4764
04:29:02.335 --> 04:29:05.838
than back in '89.

4765
04:29:05.880 --> 04:29:08.841
Forget everything you
just heard and go back to sleep.

4766
04:29:21.520 --> 04:29:23.856
I got a huge kick out of honey,
I shrunk the kids.

4767
04:29:24.106 --> 04:29:28.319
What an absolutely silly idea
that I thought was really well handled.

4768
04:29:29.945 --> 04:29:32.614
You don't realize how terrifying
all the little things around

4769
04:29:32.615 --> 04:29:36.077
you can be until you're smaller
than everything.

4770
04:29:37.036 --> 04:29:38.662
Honey, I shrunk the kids is about

4771
04:29:38.663 --> 04:29:41.790
a scientist played by Rick moranis,
who accidentally shrinks his kids

4772
04:29:41.791 --> 04:29:45.627
and they have to traverse this backyard
in order to get back home and, you know,

4773
04:29:45.628 --> 04:29:49.507
fight all sorts of dangers in his backyard
now that they're this big.

4774
04:29:49.548 --> 04:29:51.549
I shrunk the kids.

4775
04:29:51.550 --> 04:29:53.552
What?

4776
04:29:53.594 --> 04:29:55.697
The Thompson kids too. They are
about this big, they're in the backyard.

4777
04:29:55.721 --> 04:29:57.138
- What?!
- Threw them out with the trash.

4778
04:29:57.139 --> 04:30:00.767
It's a dead lift on the Richard Matheson
story, the incredible shrinking man,

4779
04:30:00.768 --> 04:30:03.896
which was one of my favorite sci
fi movies when I was a kid.

4780
04:30:04.814 --> 04:30:06.606
Matheson was very ahead of his time.

4781
04:30:06.607 --> 04:30:08.609
There's allusions to that movie in it.

4782
04:30:08.776 --> 04:30:12.154
There are sequences where they're fighting
certain insects as an homage

4783
04:30:12.196 --> 04:30:15.116
to those movies of the past.

4784
04:30:16.367 --> 04:30:18.284
Honey, I shrunk the kids.

4785
04:30:18.285 --> 04:30:21.287
The movie was called teeny weenies
and gave me an opportunity

4786
04:30:21.288 --> 04:30:25.960
to work with my buddy Joe johnston
on his first theatrical feature film.

4787
04:30:26.669 --> 04:30:28.963
There was a big scorpion scene.

4788
04:30:31.173 --> 04:30:35.261
What we essentially did
was that, the fighting ant

4789
04:30:35.386 --> 04:30:38.681
and going after these children,
and the ant comes to the rescue.

4790
04:30:40.182 --> 04:30:43.935
Stop motion creatures,
you don't want camera moves to drive

4791
04:30:43.936 --> 04:30:47.148
the performance, we want the performance
to drive the camera.

4792
04:30:47.565 --> 04:30:50.818
And then there is another unit down
in Los Angeles

4793
04:30:50.985 --> 04:30:54.530
with Dave Allen that was doing
the other scenes with the ant.

4794
04:30:56.115 --> 04:30:58.200
One of the things about making
movies in the '803

4795
04:30:58.409 --> 04:31:00.827
that people today
don't necessarily understand

4796
04:31:00.828 --> 04:31:03.956
is how many different solutions to things
you had to find.

4797
04:31:04.039 --> 04:31:06.333
You couldn't just
throw it into a computer, and that's it.

4798
04:31:06.625 --> 04:31:09.878
You had to use force
perspective, miniatures and bigatures,

4799
04:31:09.879 --> 04:31:13.090
and sometimes in the single scene,
you might have a animatronic

4800
04:31:13.215 --> 04:31:16.677
and the kids are riding on
and then a close up that's just a head.

4801
04:31:16.802 --> 04:31:19.179
It's an entirely different prop.

4802
04:31:19.180 --> 04:31:21.473
And you had to really sort of
think about how you were going to do

4803
04:31:21.474 --> 04:31:24.935
every single shot in a movie
and come up with a different unique

4804
04:31:25.269 --> 04:31:26.604
solution.

4805
04:31:26.645 --> 04:31:28.522
Thanks for the lift, anty.

4806
04:31:28.564 --> 04:31:31.484
It has this esthetic
that is not quite realistic looking

4807
04:31:31.609 --> 04:31:34.611
in a lot of places,
but it 100% works for the movie

4808
04:31:34.612 --> 04:31:37.740
and the tone of the movie that they're
telling. These giant blades of grass

4809
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:41.035
look exactly how they
should look for that movie.

4810
04:31:43.996 --> 04:31:44.872
The great thing about

4811
04:31:44.873 --> 04:31:46.998
knowing that a movie was done
practically is that you know

4812
04:31:46.999 --> 04:31:49.542
that at some point there was
actually a kid swimming around

4813
04:31:49.543 --> 04:31:53.047
in a giant bowl of milk
using a giant cheerio as a life preserver.

4814
04:31:53.088 --> 04:31:55.674
Help! Don't eat me!

4815
04:31:57.843 --> 04:31:59.010
Some of us feel like
the world was getting a little

4816
04:31:59.011 --> 04:32:02.389
too cynical for its own good,
a little too self-aware for its own good.

4817
04:32:02.431 --> 04:32:04.557
A movie like honey, I shrunk the
kids was just like, look, let's just go,

4818
04:32:04.558 --> 04:32:07.353
enjoy ourselves and enjoy the innocence
and sweetness of the world.

4819
04:32:08.938 --> 04:32:10.730
It's always got a place on my shelf

4820
04:32:10.731 --> 04:32:12.358
for that reason.

4821
04:32:12.399 --> 04:32:16.194
Nick! I've got six hours to get home,
get big, and get to the mall.

4822
04:32:16.195 --> 04:32:18.197
Now get moving!

4823
04:32:23.619 --> 04:32:25.621
I'm James Cameron

4824
04:32:25.663 --> 04:32:29.750
and I want to take you into
a world of cold darkness

4825
04:32:29.792 --> 04:32:31.794
and unrelenting pressue.

4826
04:32:32.044 --> 04:32:35.172
The abyss is a film
that's made on a frontier

4827
04:32:35.881 --> 04:32:38.300
in terms of the physicality of how

4828
04:32:38.342 --> 04:32:40.886
they made the film literally undennater

4829
04:32:41.595 --> 04:32:45.766
as a film made in a frontier of technology
and filmmaking ability

4830
04:32:46.141 --> 04:32:49.394
and a classic camera
and storytelling sense.

4831
04:32:49.395 --> 04:32:51.105
It's a mix of things.

4832
04:32:52.565 --> 04:32:54.566
It's a bottomless pit, baby.

4833
04:32:54.567 --> 04:32:56.569
Two and a half miles,
straight down.

4834
04:32:56.610 --> 04:32:57.735
Mary Elizabeth mastrantonio

4835
04:32:57.736 --> 04:33:01.198
and ed Harris, the two lead
characters, are an estranged couple.

4836
04:33:04.785 --> 04:33:06.618
Under extreme circumstances,

4837
04:33:06.619 --> 04:33:08.414
love flourishes.

4838
04:33:08.580 --> 04:33:10.582
You can do this.

4839
04:33:10.624 --> 04:33:12.332
It's a lovely inversion of aliens

4840
04:33:12.333 --> 04:33:15.503
in a way. The Navy seals
are the bad guys

4841
04:33:15.504 --> 04:33:17.547
and the aliens are the good guys.

4842
04:33:20.050 --> 04:33:22.759
Wouldn't you have liked the picture better
if they hadn't had the aliens down there

4843
04:33:22.760 --> 04:33:24.554
and just spent more time
with the rest of us

4844
04:33:24.555 --> 04:33:27.181
I just think they just put in another
element that was more fun.

4845
04:33:27.182 --> 04:33:28.684
It doesn't work for me.

4846
04:33:28.725 --> 04:33:30.686
Aliens was a cakewalk
compared to the abyss.

4847
04:33:32.021 --> 04:33:35.314
Jim Cameron, he doesn't suffer fools,
but the reason why

4848
04:33:35.315 --> 04:33:38.902
he's known as being a taskmaster
is because he's done the work

4849
04:33:39.069 --> 04:33:42.655
and he expects all of the crew
to work as hard as he is.

4850
04:33:43.824 --> 04:33:46.242
Crew members actually
had a t-shirt that said

4851
04:33:46.868 --> 04:33:49.121
life's abyss, and then you dive.

4852
04:33:50.455 --> 04:33:52.456
He was almost his ethos as a filmmaker.

4853
04:33:52.457 --> 04:33:54.000
I will make the impossible.

4854
04:33:54.001 --> 04:33:56.587
I will find a way of doing these things.

4855
04:33:57.963 --> 04:34:00.424
They shot it and these nuclear silos,

4856
04:34:00.799 --> 04:34:04.053
and gaffney filled it with water,
filled it with chlorine.

4857
04:34:05.261 --> 04:34:09.724
They had to put black beads across the top
of the tank to stop the light getting in,

4858
04:34:10.059 --> 04:34:13.020
but it allowed you to get out of the water
in case of emergencies.

4859
04:34:14.605 --> 04:34:18.315
It's dangerous filmmaking like that
you can get the bends just in the olympic

4860
04:34:18.317 --> 04:34:21.277
swimming pool or at 18 feet deep
if you jump up too quick.

4861
04:34:22.153 --> 04:34:27.785
They had to take their time at the end
of the day to safely get out of that set.

4862
04:34:27.826 --> 04:34:29.827
- Bud.
- Relax now, bud.

4863
04:34:29.828 --> 04:34:31.664
Watch me.

4864
04:34:31.705 --> 04:34:32.997
That sequence where

4865
04:34:32.998 --> 04:34:35.832
they had to basically breathe in water.

4866
04:34:35.833 --> 04:34:38.837
I was like that when I saw them, I just
I couldn't believe it.

4867
04:34:39.796 --> 04:34:42.132
And he had breathed the liquid oxygen,
that's fake.

4868
04:34:42.383 --> 04:34:44.927
So he has to hold his breath.

4869
04:34:44.969 --> 04:34:47.688
We all breathed liquid for nine
months, bud. Your body will remember.

4870
04:34:49.431 --> 04:34:53.310
A Navy seal demonstrates
you can breathe liquid oxygen,

4871
04:34:53.601 --> 04:34:57.106
and that is a real demonstration
of the effect, the experiment.

4872
04:34:57.398 --> 04:34:59.900
There were five rats, five takes.

4873
04:35:00.067 --> 04:35:02.069
The fifth rat struggled.

4874
04:35:02.902 --> 04:35:05.698
Cameron had to give it cpr.

4875
04:35:05.739 --> 04:35:07.241
- See? He's fine.
- It's a she.

4876
04:35:07.282 --> 04:35:08.574
But the endurance test

4877
04:35:08.575 --> 04:35:12.788
for the filmmakers
and for the cast was beyond difficult.

4878
04:35:12.997 --> 04:35:17.291
Everyone had experiences on it,
which will kind of make or break moments.

4879
04:35:17.292 --> 04:35:20.461
They had safety divers,
they called angels.

4880
04:35:20.462 --> 04:35:22.857
Okay, that was a good take Edward. I
want to print that, but let's do it again.

4881
04:35:22.881 --> 04:35:25.008
Ed Harris, a tough guy.

4882
04:35:25.008 --> 04:35:27.969
He had to swim under water
for about 40 meters,

4883
04:35:27.970 --> 04:35:31.432
and there are scenes where he just at the
brink of not being able to breathe anymore.

4884
04:35:34.726 --> 04:35:35.601
Cameron himself has

4885
04:35:35.603 --> 04:35:38.443
an incredible story because people forget
he would just stay undennater.

4886
04:35:38.647 --> 04:35:41.668
He had wights and everything. He could
keep himself at the bottom of the tank.

4887
04:35:41.692 --> 04:35:44.111
And Cameron pulls on his oxygen mask.

4888
04:35:44.527 --> 04:35:46.822
Nothing. And he goes, I'm in trouble.

4889
04:35:47.280 --> 04:35:49.908
And that's when a safety diver
thinks he's in distress

4890
04:35:50.284 --> 04:35:53.287
because he is
and comes out with a respirator

4891
04:35:53.787 --> 04:35:56.999
and puts the respirator in Ron,
pulls water

4892
04:35:57.249 --> 04:35:59.418
straight into his lungs,

4893
04:36:00.252 --> 04:36:03.338
and he starts to push away
because he's going to drown.

4894
04:36:04.214 --> 04:36:05.339
And the guy holds him closer

4895
04:36:05.340 --> 04:36:08.719
because he thinks he's struggling
because he's lack of oxygen.

4896
04:36:09.303 --> 04:36:11.512
And the story is Cameron punches him.

4897
04:36:11.555 --> 04:36:12.222
The only thing

4898
04:36:12.223 --> 04:36:16.268
last thing he can do is punch the guy
and break through into the surface.

4899
04:36:16.560 --> 04:36:20.230
His assistant and the safety diver
were fired on the same day,

4900
04:36:21.273 --> 04:36:23.433
and he was back down the boat
in the tank within hours.

4901
04:36:23.650 --> 04:36:25.151
That's James Cameron for you.

4902
04:36:25.151 --> 04:36:28.489
That's the abyss for you.

4903
04:36:40.208 --> 04:36:42.211
What the hell is going on?

4904
04:36:43.795 --> 04:36:45.045
Back to the future ii picks up

4905
04:36:45.046 --> 04:36:48.592
exactly where the last film left off.

4906
04:36:50.177 --> 04:36:51.760
And then we go to the far off

4907
04:36:51.761 --> 04:36:55.098
future of the year 2015.

4908
04:36:57.100 --> 04:36:59.103
The future. Unbelievable.

4909
04:36:59.144 --> 04:37:00.436
We are big believers

4910
04:37:00.437 --> 04:37:03.023
in the set it up, pay it off.

4911
04:37:03.482 --> 04:37:06.985
We thought to ourselves, hill
valley needs to be recognizable.

4912
04:37:07.069 --> 04:37:12.866
It's recognizable from 1955 to 1985
and in 1985 to 2015.

4913
04:37:13.075 --> 04:37:16.327
It has to be recognizable as well.

4914
04:37:16.328 --> 04:37:18.747
The great splendor of back to the future

4915
04:37:19.039 --> 04:37:24.211
really is its ethos is 1950,
when in terms of science fiction,

4916
04:37:24.461 --> 04:37:26.294
the dream was a flying car

4917
04:37:26.295 --> 04:37:28.690
and the cities of the future
and that's where back to the future

4918
04:37:28.715 --> 04:37:33.846
part ii comes in, is that it's just jokes
about 1950's idealization of the future

4919
04:37:37.391 --> 04:37:39.976
and all of those kind
of consumerist ideas,

4920
04:37:40.144 --> 04:37:43.437
wonderful kind of humaristic things.

4921
04:37:43.437 --> 04:37:47.651
We thought about how does the world change.
You recognize a time period

4922
04:37:47.943 --> 04:37:51.404
on a pop culture level
based on what new products look like.

4923
04:37:51.446 --> 04:37:53.407
Is it ready?

4924
04:37:53.699 --> 04:37:57.786
We were very cognizant
about choosing brands

4925
04:37:58.119 --> 04:38:00.830
that would give us a change in period.

4926
04:38:00.873 --> 04:38:02.875
All I want is a Pepsi.

4927
04:38:04.168 --> 04:38:07.170
That's what's going to make
people feel comfortable

4928
04:38:07.379 --> 04:38:09.381
that this is where we are.

4929
04:38:09.422 --> 04:38:11.425
Drying mode on.

4930
04:38:13.009 --> 04:38:13.427
Even though

4931
04:38:13.428 --> 04:38:17.139
2015, as depicted in back to the future
I! Didn't quite pan out

4932
04:38:17.264 --> 04:38:20.391
in reality, we all still want
a hoverboard and

4933
04:38:20.392 --> 04:38:23.854
I still want a pair of those self-lacing
Nike tennis shoes.

4934
04:38:25.438 --> 04:38:28.442
We didn't get 19 jaws movies.

4935
04:38:30.986 --> 04:38:34.614
They forecast our obsession
with the '803,

4936
04:38:34.615 --> 04:38:37.159
so they were on point with that.

4937
04:38:39.368 --> 04:38:41.663
There's a whole like genetic line of this

4938
04:38:41.705 --> 04:38:42.705
really,

4939
04:38:43.331 --> 04:38:44.041
really

4940
04:38:44.042 --> 04:38:48.127
good writing as far as a villain
that just carries all the things

4941
04:38:48.128 --> 04:38:50.505
that really trigger us
and push our buttons.

4942
04:38:50.546 --> 04:38:53.633
What's wrong with mcfly?
Chicken?

4943
04:38:57.637 --> 04:38:59.473
We all know a biff.

4944
04:39:02.309 --> 04:39:04.311
Go get it!

4945
04:39:04.353 --> 04:39:05.853
Back to the future ii gets

4946
04:39:05.854 --> 04:39:08.523
real dark, real fast.

4947
04:39:08.564 --> 04:39:11.735
Somewhere in the past, the timeline
skewed into this this tangent

4948
04:39:11.776 --> 04:39:13.778
creating an alternate 1985.

4949
04:39:15.279 --> 04:39:16.697
Time paradoxes, man.

4950
04:39:16.698 --> 04:39:18.741
You don't know what's going to happen.

4951
04:39:18.784 --> 04:39:20.786
Third time's the charm.

4952
04:39:25.123 --> 04:39:27.124
The way that you see
characters have changed

4953
04:39:27.125 --> 04:39:31.213
as a result of this new timeline
and these new actions that have happened.

4954
04:39:31.505 --> 04:39:33.715
You're very much in Marty's shoes of like

4955
04:39:33.757 --> 04:39:35.883
this is not the way
the world is supposed to be.

4956
04:39:35.883 --> 04:39:38.011
And how did it get this way
and how do I fix it?

4957
04:39:38.220 --> 04:39:41.847
Doc, what if we don't succeed?

4958
04:39:41.848 --> 04:39:43.850
We must succeed!

4959
04:39:45.352 --> 04:39:45.978
The cool thing

4960
04:39:45.979 --> 04:39:50.147
about back to the future ii
is where they go back in time again

4961
04:39:50.148 --> 04:39:53.234
to the events of the first movie,
and you now have this second Marty

4962
04:39:53.235 --> 04:39:56.113
running around
witnessing the events of the first movie

4963
04:39:56.446 --> 04:40:00.450
and you get the sense that that was always
happening behind the scenes

4964
04:40:00.742 --> 04:40:02.327
while the first movie was going on.

4965
04:40:06.248 --> 04:40:08.124
As a time travel junkie,

4966
04:40:08.125 --> 04:40:10.668
the idea of reinserting yourself
back into another set of events

4967
04:40:10.669 --> 04:40:14.381
that you've already gone through once
it just cracks me up.

4968
04:40:16.174 --> 04:40:18.092
This '80s nostalgia

4969
04:40:18.093 --> 04:40:22.054
that existed in these sort of future 2015,
which was obviously meant to mimic

4970
04:40:22.055 --> 04:40:25.017
the 1950s nostalgia
that people had in the 1980s.

4971
04:40:25.142 --> 04:40:27.894
But when you're in the 19803,
you don't think of that that way

4972
04:40:28.103 --> 04:40:31.857
to see that come true,
to have lived long enough to see what

4973
04:40:32.024 --> 04:40:35.609
I grew up and
become this nostalgia thing.

4974
04:40:35.610 --> 04:40:35.861
I don't know.

4975
04:40:35.862 --> 04:40:38.070
In one sense,
it makes me feel a little old,

4976
04:40:38.071 --> 04:40:41.741
but it is also a thing
that was very prescient about

4977
04:40:41.742 --> 04:40:42.993
back to the future ii.

4978
04:40:43.035 --> 04:40:45.036
We have a quaint little piece
from the 19803.

4979
04:40:45.037 --> 04:40:47.039
It's called the dustbuster.

4980
04:40:53.628 --> 04:40:57.799
Science fiction, certainly
the best of science fiction is inevitably

4981
04:40:57.966 --> 04:41:02.554
a reflection of what's going on on earth
at the time it was written,

4982
04:41:03.180 --> 04:41:07.976
all works of art are ineluctable products
of the time in which they are created.

4983
04:41:09.936 --> 04:41:12.605
This isn't about space.

4984
04:41:12.606 --> 04:41:14.816
This isn't about deep water.

4985
04:41:14.858 --> 04:41:17.444
This isn't about another dimension.

4986
04:41:19.696 --> 04:41:21.447
This is about us.

4987
04:41:21.448 --> 04:41:25.451
It's really up to the audience
to decide what they want

4988
04:41:25.452 --> 04:41:28.455
out of the experience.

4989
04:41:29.706 --> 04:41:32.000
Science fiction allowed people

4990
04:41:32.209 --> 04:41:35.921
to tell stories and talk about extremely

4991
04:41:36.296 --> 04:41:39.925
important social issues

4992
04:41:40.467 --> 04:41:44.095
in ways that got people thinking,
maybe without them realizing

4993
04:41:44.096 --> 04:41:45.346
they were thinking about it.

4994
04:41:45.347 --> 04:41:47.306
We have a hard time
talking about this directly,

4995
04:41:47.307 --> 04:41:50.393
but if I tell you this story about people
who are half painted white

4996
04:41:50.394 --> 04:41:52.186
and half painted black,
hating the other people

4997
04:41:52.187 --> 04:41:54.355
who are half painted
black and half painted white.

4998
04:41:54.356 --> 04:41:58.485
The idea of racism,
we see how silly and dumb it is

4999
04:41:58.902 --> 04:42:01.738
when you sort of see it reflected
in a different set of cultural norms

5000
04:42:01.947 --> 04:42:05.659
hits you in a way
that you can't see without the metaphor.

5001
04:42:06.952 --> 04:42:10.122
Escaping when you're a little kid
or teenager

5002
04:42:10.247 --> 04:42:14.750
into the world of science
fiction is a great way to start

5003
04:42:14.751 --> 04:42:15.502
to come to terms

5004
04:42:15.503 --> 04:42:18.797
with your own personality, who you are,
where you fit in the world,

5005
04:42:19.005 --> 04:42:24.845
and they become really important
benchmarks in how you remember your youth.

5006
04:42:25.011 --> 04:42:28.140
So there's something I think that's
universal about that in terms of age.

5007
04:42:29.182 --> 04:42:31.351
A lot of these movies

5008
04:42:31.726 --> 04:42:34.520
cater to a young audience

5009
04:42:34.521 --> 04:42:38.525
that perhaps was in a real
transition in their lives.

5010
04:42:38.859 --> 04:42:42.446
And these are times in your lives
that you never forget.

5011
04:42:42.946 --> 04:42:48.160
A3 simple as these movies appear to be,
especially by today's standards,

5012
04:42:48.368 --> 04:42:54.207
there's a magic to them because of their
relateability and their intimacy.

5013
04:42:54.249 --> 04:42:58.294
It belongs to the person that it made an
imprint on, and that's the wonderful thing

5014
04:42:58.295 --> 04:43:01.338
about stories. You tell it
so that somebody else

5015
04:43:01.339 --> 04:43:04.718
can relate to it because you related to
and that's why you wanted to tell it.

5016
04:43:05.051 --> 04:43:07.929
There's something about being able to have

5017
04:43:07.971 --> 04:43:10.807
your favorite movie
and your favorite moment

5018
04:43:11.349 --> 04:43:15.896
and have it with you and watch
it as many times as you want.

5019
04:43:16.313 --> 04:43:18.230
And it became this tradition.

5020
04:43:18.231 --> 04:43:21.818
We could go rent a movie
and we could sit down with our family.

5021
04:43:22.652 --> 04:43:27.323
It was about where we were and who we were
with at the time, and we all wish

5022
04:43:27.324 --> 04:43:31.828
we could be back there in some way
doing that with those people at that time.

5023
04:43:32.078 --> 04:43:35.123
Everybody likes to remember good times.

5024
04:43:35.415 --> 04:43:37.876
Some of these movies
remind us of the good times.

5025
04:43:37.918 --> 04:43:40.879
By the way, why are we
wearing bras on our heads?

5026
04:43:41.213 --> 04:43:43.465
I think that nostalgia connects us

5027
04:43:43.507 --> 04:43:48.093
not only with an innocent part of
ourselves, but also with our imagination,

5028
04:43:48.094 --> 04:43:51.389
because as we get older,
we kind of lose that imagination.

5029
04:43:51.431 --> 04:43:55.143
Everybody has it, but it starts to
get tarnished as we get older.

5030
04:43:57.812 --> 04:43:59.730
These movies endure

5031
04:43:59.731 --> 04:44:03.151
because it's a part of us
we don't want to lose.

5032
04:44:04.486 --> 04:44:07.696
As you get older,
you want to relive those moments

5033
04:44:07.697 --> 04:44:10.366
that meant so much to you as a kid.

5034
04:44:10.367 --> 04:44:13.787
You don't want them to go away because
they're actually part of who you are.

5035
04:44:13.870 --> 04:44:17.206
I think that what you've got as artists
and filmmakers

5036
04:44:17.207 --> 04:44:20.335
are a lot of adults who are still kid3.

5037
04:44:20.961 --> 04:44:22.963
They're capable
of working in an adult world,

5038
04:44:23.505 --> 04:44:26.841
but they feel like a child
and want to express that.

5039
04:44:28.468 --> 04:44:29.261
There's something that

5040
04:44:29.262 --> 04:44:32.430
keeps these directors
making these phenomena! Films.

5041
04:44:32.556 --> 04:44:34.306
They're affecting you
in some emotional way,

5042
04:44:34.307 --> 04:44:38.227
and they're feeling that emotion
when they're making it.

5043
04:44:38.228 --> 04:44:42.148
And I'm really glad there's people around
that are listening to their inner selves.

5044
04:44:42.774 --> 04:44:45.360
Art is the one thing that looks

5045
04:44:45.652 --> 04:44:49.030
beyond the reality that we know around us

5046
04:44:49.072 --> 04:44:52.075
and it shows us what's possible

5047
04:44:52.826 --> 04:44:55.452
and it's most noble. Art shows us

5048
04:44:55.453 --> 04:44:58.039
what can be and what ought to be.

5049
04:44:58.665 --> 04:45:03.295
That is what science
fiction at its best is all about.

5050
04:45:04.296 --> 04:45:07.048
Is showing us the world of tomorrow

5051
04:45:07.799 --> 04:45:10.677
and how human life can be better

5052
04:45:11.136 --> 04:45:14.514
in the future than it is right now.

5053
04:45:15.348 --> 04:45:17.350
That's the magic of sci fi, man.
