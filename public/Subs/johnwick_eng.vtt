1
00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:36.108
John Wick, Excommunicado.

2
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:39.021
In effect, 6:00 P.M.,
Eastern Standard Time.

3
00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:34.151
I do hope that Mr. Wick
finds his way to safety.

4
00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:36.369
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

5
00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.717
And killed a man on company
grounds, Charon.

6
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.804
Do you expect him
to make it out?

7
00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:42.630
$14 million bounty on his head.

8
00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:46.412
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

9
00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:48.890
I'd say the odds are about even.

10
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.369
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

11
00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:10.890
No way!

12
00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:13.674
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

13
00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:15.717
But I know better, man.

14
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:17.543
I know better.
I know what I'm...

15
00:04:25.674 --> 00:04:27.064
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

16
00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:28.500
Tick tock.

17
00:04:29.108 --> 00:04:30.717
Tick tock.

18
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.108
Tick tock. Tick...

19
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:36.325
No time to dilly
dally, Mr. Wick!

20
00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:52.890
The New York Public Library.

21
00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:53.934
You got it.

22
00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:14.760
Change of plan.

23
00:05:17.803 --> 00:05:19.238
To the Continental.

24
00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:21.977
Can you see that he's
received by the concierge?

25
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.630
Yes sir, Mr. Wick.

26
00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:29.369
Good dog. Good dog.

27
00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:41.412
John Wick, Excommunicado.

28
00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:43.456
In effect, 20 minutes.

29
00:06:04.282 --> 00:06:05.500
Can I help you?

30
00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:08.543
Russian Folktale.
Alexander Afanasyev.

31
00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:12.543
1864.

32
00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:24.325
- Level two.
- Thank you.

33
00:07:19.587 --> 00:07:21.629
"Consider your origins."

34
00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:24.587
"You were not made
to live as brutes,"

35
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:26.803
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge."

36
00:07:29.934 --> 00:07:31.369
Dante.

37
00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:36.064
Looking a little run down
there, John.

38
00:07:36.108 --> 00:07:38.803
Ernest. I still have time.

39
00:07:38.847 --> 00:07:42.238
It's almost up.
Who's gonna know the difference?

40
00:07:42.282 --> 00:07:44.412
You sure this is
what you wanna do?

41
00:07:44.456 --> 00:07:46.282
Fourteen million.
It's a lot of money.

42
00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:47.412
Not if you can't spend it.

43
00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:35.934
John Wick, Excommunicado.

44
00:09:35.977 --> 00:09:38.238
In effect, 10 minutes.

45
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.673
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

46
00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:56.412
No help,
no services of any kind.

47
00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:11.021
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

48
00:10:12.673 --> 00:10:13.934
Mr. Wick.

49
00:10:13.977 --> 00:10:16.369
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

50
00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:18.064
I know, Doc, please.
There's still time.

51
00:10:18.108 --> 00:10:19.542
No! I can't.

52
00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.195
I still have five minutes!

53
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.760
Please.

54
00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:31.673
Come on. Come on.

55
00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:39.499
All right, sit there.

56
00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.499
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

57
00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:52.325
Puncture wound.

58
00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:55.411
Went deep. Nicked the artery.

59
00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:59.151
Here you go.

60
00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:01.369
All right.

61
00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:06.934
John Wick, Excommunicado.

62
00:11:06.977 --> 00:11:08.977
In effect, one minute.

63
00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:23.238
Doc?

64
00:11:27.847 --> 00:11:28.934
Doc?

65
00:11:28.977 --> 00:11:30.716
Yeah. We're halfway there.

66
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.195
- Five seconds.
- Yeah.

67
00:11:35.238 --> 00:11:37.542
John Wick, Excommunicado.

68
00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:42.282
In effect, in five, four...

69
00:11:42.325 --> 00:11:44.847
three, two...

70
00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:46.760
one.

71
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.890
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

72
00:11:57.934 --> 00:11:59.542
I know. Rules.

73
00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.411
Ah, rules.

74
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:09.368
John Wick, 14 million.

75
00:12:09.411 --> 00:12:11.586
Open contract is now in effect.

76
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:14.108
All services are suspended.

77
00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:46.586
And away we go.

78
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:13.716
Top shelf. On the right.

79
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.108
Yeah. Take four.

80
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:18.890
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

81
00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:29.890
Mr. Wick?

82
00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:33.803
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

83
00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:35.499
But you did.

84
00:13:35.542 --> 00:13:36.977
They'll know.

85
00:13:37.021 --> 00:13:38.368
Know what?

86
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:40.586
I told you where
the medicine was.

87
00:13:57.194 --> 00:13:59.281
Where? Here.

88
00:13:59.324 --> 00:14:00.542
Just below my floating rib.

89
00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:02.066
Be sure not to hit
my large intestine.

90
00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:06.281
Oh, wait!

91
00:14:06.324 --> 00:14:08.151
One may not be enough.

92
00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:14.108
Yeah. All right.

93
00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:16.890
Be sure not to graze my...

94
00:14:26.108 --> 00:14:27.934
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

95
00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:32.368
Thanks, Doc.

96
00:24:09.585 --> 00:24:12.020
John Wick. Open contract.

97
00:24:12.063 --> 00:24:14.499
Increase, 15 million.

98
00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:19.455
Where are you going, Jonathan?

99
00:24:28.585 --> 00:24:30.020
We are closed.

100
00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:31.498
Jardani. Why have you come home?

101
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.498
You present this to
me like an answer.

102
00:26:39.541 --> 00:26:41.715
I still have my ticket.

103
00:26:43.324 --> 00:26:46.324
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

104
00:26:46.368 --> 00:26:48.672
you think your ticket is valid?

105
00:26:48.715 --> 00:26:52.759
You forget that the Ruska Roma
is bound by the High Table,

106
00:26:52.802 --> 00:26:56.107
and the High Table
stands above all?

107
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.411
They could kill me just
for talking to you.

108
00:26:59.976 --> 00:27:04.933
You honor me by bringing
death to my front door.

109
00:27:06.802 --> 00:27:11.020
Oh Jardani,
what has become of you?

110
00:27:29.237 --> 00:27:31.281
You are bound...

111
00:27:31.324 --> 00:27:33.715
And I am owed.

112
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.846
Rooney, enough!

113
00:28:11.324 --> 00:28:14.281
"You are owed." You are owed
nothing, Jardani.

114
00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:18.237
You know, when my pupils first come
here, they wish for one thing.

115
00:28:18.281 --> 00:28:20.672
A life free of suffering.

116
00:28:20.715 --> 00:28:23.454
I try to dissuade them from
these childish notions.

117
00:28:23.498 --> 00:28:27.933
But as you know, art is pain.

118
00:28:31.454 --> 00:28:33.454
Life is suffering.

119
00:28:38.367 --> 00:28:40.672
Somehow, you managed to get out.

120
00:28:41.802 --> 00:28:44.020
But here you are,
back where you began.

121
00:28:45.107 --> 00:28:47.194
All of this, for what?

122
00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:33.323
Sit.

123
00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:51.759
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

124
00:29:52.715 --> 00:29:55.020
The High Table wants your life.

125
00:29:55.802 --> 00:29:58.628
How can you fight the wind?

126
00:29:58.672 --> 00:30:00.367
How can you smash the mountains?

127
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.933
How can you Bury the ocean?

128
00:30:02.976 --> 00:30:05.585
How can you escape
from the light?

129
00:30:05.628 --> 00:30:08.280
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

130
00:30:08.323 --> 00:30:10.323
But they're in the dark, too.

131
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:17.846
So tell me, Jardani.
What do you really want?

132
00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:21.759
Passage.

133
00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:24.541
Where did you want to go?

134
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.236
Casablanca.

135
00:30:30.194 --> 00:30:33.280
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

136
00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:40.150
So be it.

137
00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:43.933
You hand me your
ticket, I will tear it.

138
00:30:45.107 --> 00:30:47.280
If that's what
you really desire.

139
00:31:26.672 --> 00:31:30.193
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

140
00:31:39.802 --> 00:31:41.802
You can never come home again.

141
00:31:43.976 --> 00:31:45.498
Take him to the lifeboat.

142
00:31:47.107 --> 00:31:48.323
Do svidaniya.

143
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.107
Do svidaniya.

144
00:32:23.889 --> 00:32:27.020
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

145
00:32:45.454 --> 00:32:50.149
Sir. There is an
Adjudicator here to see you.

146
00:32:51.933 --> 00:32:53.062
Very well, sir.

147
00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:58.280
The manager is in the lounge.

148
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:06.933
I presume you're here
to discuss John Wick.

149
00:33:06.976 --> 00:33:09.498
If that's so,
we can make this short.

150
00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:13.106
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

151
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:14.541
And that's the all of it.

152
00:33:15.585 --> 00:33:16.933
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

153
00:33:16.976 --> 00:33:19.280
Oh, yes.

154
00:33:19.323 --> 00:33:21.454
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

155
00:33:21.498 --> 00:33:22.628
You're mistaken.

156
00:33:22.672 --> 00:33:24.541
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

157
00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:27.106
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

158
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:28.541
The blood was spilt

159
00:33:28.585 --> 00:33:30.846
on the grounds of the Continental.
Was it not?

160
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:32.062
Oh, yes.

161
00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:36.280
As a matter of fact, the body gets
colder within these very walls.

162
00:33:36.323 --> 00:33:38.541
I'd like to see it.

163
00:34:06.454 --> 00:34:09.322
Santino D'Antonio.

164
00:34:09.367 --> 00:34:11.498
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

165
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:15.541
slain by Mr. Wick while seeking
sanctuary in the Continental.

166
00:34:19.715 --> 00:34:23.367
With a .45 ACP, it appears.

167
00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:26.280
I had no control over
Mr. Wick's actions.

168
00:34:26.322 --> 00:34:29.149
And yet, he lives because
you deemed it so, yes?

169
00:34:29.933 --> 00:34:31.193
Yes.

170
00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:33.367
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

171
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.498
It might even be fair to
call you friends, yes?

172
00:34:36.846 --> 00:34:38.975
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

173
00:34:39.018 --> 00:34:40.889
you stood by and
let him walk away

174
00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:43.409
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

175
00:34:43.454 --> 00:34:45.454
I made him Excommunicado.

176
00:34:45.498 --> 00:34:48.409
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

177
00:34:48.454 --> 00:34:50.018
He broke the rules in <i>my</i> hotel.

178
00:34:50.062 --> 00:34:52.585
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

179
00:34:52.628 --> 00:34:55.062
Where is your fealty?

180
00:34:55.106 --> 00:34:57.280
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

181
00:34:57.323 --> 00:34:59.454
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

182
00:34:59.498 --> 00:35:01.236
Everything is under the Table.

183
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.908
I understand that you
have your loyalties,

184
00:35:02.932 --> 00:35:04.323
but this cannot be overlooked.

185
00:35:04.367 --> 00:35:07.889
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

186
00:35:07.932 --> 00:35:09.772
You have one week to get
your affairs in order.

187
00:35:11.149 --> 00:35:12.323
Excuse me?

188
00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:15.149
At such time,
your successor will be named.

189
00:35:16.932 --> 00:35:20.236
There are rules, they are the
only things that separate us...

190
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.628
- From the animals.
- Yes.

191
00:35:22.672 --> 00:35:24.498
You have seven days.

192
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.541
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

193
00:35:31.585 --> 00:35:34.367
you may look for me in room 217.

194
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.454
Enjoy your stay at
the Continental.

195
00:35:50.498 --> 00:35:52.975
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

196
00:36:06.888 --> 00:36:10.280
Welcome to my Mission Control.

197
00:36:10.323 --> 00:36:13.672
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

198
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:16.019
From whence I control
the word on the street,

199
00:36:16.062 --> 00:36:17.280
the way of the world.

200
00:36:17.323 --> 00:36:18.672
With pigeons.

201
00:36:18.715 --> 00:36:22.672
Yes. You see rats with wings
but I see the Internet.

202
00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:27.845
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

203
00:36:27.888 --> 00:36:31.585
Can't track it, can't hack
it, can't trace it.

204
00:36:31.628 --> 00:36:34.367
Can you get disease from it?

205
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.759
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

206
00:36:37.672 --> 00:36:39.845
What the hell do you want?

207
00:36:39.888 --> 00:36:41.802
I wanted to see where
it didn't happen.

208
00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:43.541
Where what didn't happen?

209
00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:45.323
Where you didn't kill John Wick.

210
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:47.864
I've always been
under the impression

211
00:36:47.888 --> 00:36:50.759
that contracts and
executing them was optional.

212
00:36:50.802 --> 00:36:52.802
I have no problem
with John Wick.

213
00:36:59.062 --> 00:37:02.585
And yet, you gave John a
seven-round Kimber 1911,

214
00:37:02.628 --> 00:37:05.506
knowing that he intended to use
it to stand against the Table.

215
00:37:05.507 --> 00:37:06.507
Yes?

216
00:37:10.585 --> 00:37:13.323
This Kimber 1911, to be exact.

217
00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:22.498
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

218
00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:25.280
the High Table is
giving you seven days.

219
00:37:25.323 --> 00:37:27.628
Seven days for what, exactly?

220
00:37:27.672 --> 00:37:31.410
To settle your affairs and
find a new home for your birds.

221
00:37:31.454 --> 00:37:33.888
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

222
00:37:46.193 --> 00:37:47.672
Oh, my dear.

223
00:37:47.715 --> 00:37:50.236
Tell me, do you know what the Bowery
is, Adjudicator?

224
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.845
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

225
00:37:52.888 --> 00:37:56.323
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

226
00:37:56.367 --> 00:37:58.888
Because I am the throne, baby.

227
00:37:58.932 --> 00:38:01.106
I am the Bowery!

228
00:38:02.498 --> 00:38:04.585
I am all that you
deign not to look at

229
00:38:04.628 --> 00:38:06.082
when you walk down
the street at night.

230
00:38:06.106 --> 00:38:09.932
The Bowery is mine. Mine alone.

231
00:38:10.975 --> 00:38:16.193
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you exist outside the rules, no men do.

232
00:38:16.236 --> 00:38:18.019
You have seven days.

233
00:39:57.888 --> 00:39:59.367
Enough!

234
00:40:04.845 --> 00:40:07.801
I'm afraid our friend
here is off limits.

235
00:40:07.845 --> 00:40:10.758
But he's Excommunicado.

236
00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:13.498
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

237
00:40:14.888 --> 00:40:19.193
Mr. Jonathan, would you be
so kind as to come with me?

238
00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:42.410
Welcome to Casablanca, Mr. Wick.

239
00:40:42.454 --> 00:40:44.454
Thanks.

240
00:40:49.236 --> 00:40:52.410
Mr. Jonathan, it has been a
long time since our fine city

241
00:40:52.454 --> 00:40:54.193
has been graced
with your presence.

242
00:40:54.758 --> 00:40:56.019
I need to talk to...

243
00:40:56.062 --> 00:40:58.280
Yes, Ms.
Al-Azwar, she's expecting you.

244
00:41:05.367 --> 00:41:09.062
My, my, welcome to the
Moroccan Continental.

245
00:41:09.106 --> 00:41:10.975
I hope you'll find
it to your taste.

246
00:41:12.888 --> 00:41:14.193
Right this way.

247
00:41:14.236 --> 00:41:17.062
Ms. Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

248
00:41:20.932 --> 00:41:25.758
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

249
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.236
You a dog person, John?

250
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.323
Sofia?

251
00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:11.627
Sofia!

252
00:42:11.671 --> 00:42:14.149
You can't kill the
bearer of your marker.

253
00:42:14.193 --> 00:42:17.280
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

254
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.497
Nice suit.

255
00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:23.627
Good to see you, too.

256
00:42:23.671 --> 00:42:26.149
I should shoot you in
the head right now.

257
00:42:26.193 --> 00:42:27.584
I know.

258
00:42:32.888 --> 00:42:34.845
Don't you do it.

259
00:42:36.193 --> 00:42:38.671
You're Excommunicado, John.

260
00:42:38.714 --> 00:42:43.323
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

261
00:42:48.454 --> 00:42:50.454
This is your blood.

262
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.627
Your bond.

263
00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:58.410
When you needed
help, I was there.

264
00:43:06.367 --> 00:43:07.453
Sit.

265
00:43:11.367 --> 00:43:13.801
I was talking to you, John.

266
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.845
You do realize that I'm
management now, right?

267
00:43:22.888 --> 00:43:24.758
I'm not service anymore, John.

268
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:28.497
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

269
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.019
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

270
00:43:31.062 --> 00:43:33.497
I just need you
to get me to him.

271
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.193
- To who?
- Your old boss.

272
00:43:38.193 --> 00:43:39.627
You want to kill Berrada.

273
00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:41.671
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

274
00:43:41.714 --> 00:43:44.280
What could he
possibly give to you?

275
00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:48.367
Guidance.

276
00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:53.193
Look, I made a deal when I
agreed to run this hotel.

277
00:43:53.236 --> 00:43:57.367
And that deal said that I had to
follow the rules of the Table.

278
00:43:57.409 --> 00:44:00.627
If you're not gonna kill
him, he is gonna kill you,

279
00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:04.280
and then probably me too,
for walking you up in there.

280
00:44:04.323 --> 00:44:07.975
If I make one
mistake, one enemy...

281
00:44:09.367 --> 00:44:12.801
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

282
00:44:14.453 --> 00:44:17.367
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

283
00:44:18.627 --> 00:44:22.845
But that's not a chance I can take.
Sorry.

284
00:44:24.975 --> 00:44:27.236
Do you wanna know where she is?

285
00:44:28.106 --> 00:44:31.193
No. I don't ever wanna know.

286
00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:34.106
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

287
00:44:35.453 --> 00:44:39.540
A part of me longs for her.

288
00:44:39.584 --> 00:44:43.540
And I have to kill that
part of myself every day,

289
00:44:43.584 --> 00:44:45.149
just to keep her safe.

290
00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:55.540
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

291
00:44:55.584 --> 00:44:58.280
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

292
00:44:58.323 --> 00:45:02.453
That's why I'm sitting here right
now and that's why I'm fucked!

293
00:45:07.932 --> 00:45:10.106
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

294
00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:13.801
Consequences.

295
00:45:15.888 --> 00:45:18.019
I'm just asking you to try.

296
00:45:19.106 --> 00:45:20.714
Either way, you and me...

297
00:45:21.409 --> 00:45:22.888
we'll be even.

298
00:45:33.932 --> 00:45:35.236
No.

299
00:45:36.497 --> 00:45:42.062
After this,
we are less than even.

300
00:45:46.062 --> 00:45:47.932
We leave in 10 minutes.

301
00:46:44.758 --> 00:46:46.106
How can I help you?

302
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.888
I wasn't expecting the
High Table so soon.

303
00:47:03.366 --> 00:47:05.322
There is a task.

304
00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:08.758
It involves someone who broke the
rules and stood against the Table.

305
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.932
John Wick, you mean.

306
00:47:12.975 --> 00:47:14.888
My students have not been idle.

307
00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:18.192
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

308
00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.322
You've heard the stories about
him, of course.

309
00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:22.975
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

310
00:47:23.019 --> 00:47:25.453
A dog, a car.

311
00:47:26.366 --> 00:47:27.497
I'm familiar.

312
00:47:30.845 --> 00:47:32.497
And I'm interested.

313
00:47:33.801 --> 00:47:34.975
Very.

314
00:47:41.584 --> 00:47:44.497
Blowfish. Very fatal.

315
00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.497
No soy.

316
00:47:59.106 --> 00:48:02.671
I have served,
I will be of service.

317
00:49:43.801 --> 00:49:45.453
Stop!

318
00:49:51.975 --> 00:49:53.061
Out!

319
00:49:59.671 --> 00:50:03.061
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

320
00:50:03.105 --> 00:50:06.148
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

321
00:50:06.192 --> 00:50:07.366
He had a ticket.

322
00:50:07.409 --> 00:50:09.888
But a ticket does not
stand above the Table.

323
00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:12.801
Your penance will
be paid in blood.

324
00:50:13.453 --> 00:50:14.453
Now...

325
00:50:17.322 --> 00:50:21.758
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

326
00:50:29.975 --> 00:50:35.322
I have served,
I will be of service.

327
00:50:58.148 --> 00:51:00.148
We're not going in
like the old days.

328
00:51:01.018 --> 00:51:03.540
It's just a conversation.

329
00:51:03.584 --> 00:51:07.409
Nothing's ever just a
conversation with you, John.

330
00:51:11.279 --> 00:51:12.671
Let's go.

331
00:51:36.845 --> 00:51:38.584
Sofia.

332
00:51:38.627 --> 00:51:41.366
Always so nice to see you.

333
00:51:41.409 --> 00:51:45.105
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

334
00:51:46.105 --> 00:51:47.235
Certainly.

335
00:51:51.409 --> 00:51:53.235
Fantastic.

336
00:51:53.974 --> 00:51:56.627
Jonathan Wick.

337
00:51:56.671 --> 00:51:59.758
I had heard you had made
your way to our shores.

338
00:52:05.584 --> 00:52:07.322
Come along now.

339
00:52:07.366 --> 00:52:09.322
I am certain we have
much to discuss.

340
00:52:13.888 --> 00:52:18.366
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

341
00:52:19.888 --> 00:52:21.148
Tell me.

342
00:52:21.192 --> 00:52:23.105
Do you come here to kill me?

343
00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:26.497
No.

344
00:52:35.627 --> 00:52:40.018
Mr. Wick, do you know where
the word "assassin" comes from?

345
00:52:41.671 --> 00:52:45.061
People argue. "Assassin".

346
00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:50.235
Hashasheen,
followers of Hassan-i.

347
00:52:51.584 --> 00:52:54.322
Eaters of hashish.

348
00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:57.148
No, thank you.

349
00:52:58.627 --> 00:53:02.018
But others contend it
comes from "asāsiyyūn".

350
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:06.366
Meaning, "men who are faithful
and who abide by their beliefs".

351
00:53:08.279 --> 00:53:10.714
You see that coin?

352
00:53:10.758 --> 00:53:14.279
The first coin ever
minted in this facility.

353
00:53:14.322 --> 00:53:17.671
Next to it, the first marker.

354
00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:20.279
Not easy to track
down, believe me.

355
00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:24.887
Now, this coin of course,
it does not represent monetary value.

356
00:53:24.931 --> 00:53:28.061
It represents the
commerce of relationships,

357
00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:31.453
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

358
00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:34.279
Order and rules.

359
00:53:35.279 --> 00:53:37.192
You have broken the rules.

360
00:53:37.235 --> 00:53:40.409
The High Table has
marked you for death.

361
00:53:40.453 --> 00:53:42.453
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

362
00:53:42.497 --> 00:53:46.453
when your life has been by
your own actions, forfeit?

363
00:53:51.584 --> 00:53:53.453
I seek to make amends.

364
00:53:54.322 --> 00:53:56.627
To pay for what I've done.

365
00:53:56.671 --> 00:54:00.366
I seek a meeting with the
one who sits above the Table.

366
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.627
This dog, I do so love it.

367
00:54:08.671 --> 00:54:11.584
Tell me,
does it shed a great deal?

368
00:54:14.409 --> 00:54:16.540
Occasionally.

369
00:54:16.584 --> 00:54:19.800
When I leave,
you can tell the Elder I'm coming.

370
00:54:19.844 --> 00:54:21.340
And if he wants me dead...

371
00:54:21.351 --> 00:54:24.758
Then he will see to it that
your bones bleach under the sun.

372
00:54:25.758 --> 00:54:27.497
I see.

373
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.671
And I would have provided
him with a choice.

374
00:54:37.105 --> 00:54:38.322
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

375
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:42.192
I cannot tell you where
to find the Elder.

376
00:54:45.105 --> 00:54:47.018
You fail to understand.

377
00:54:47.061 --> 00:54:49.105
The Elder is not a man you find.

378
00:54:49.148 --> 00:54:51.540
He can only choose to find <i>you</i>.

379
00:54:51.584 --> 00:54:53.540
You wish to speak with him?

380
00:54:53.584 --> 00:54:56.931
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

381
00:54:56.974 --> 00:55:01.844
Canis Minor, the dog that
followed Orion through the sky.

382
00:55:01.887 --> 00:55:03.931
You follow the brightest star.

383
00:55:03.974 --> 00:55:06.497
Walk until you are almost dead.

384
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.192
Then, keep walking.

385
00:55:09.235 --> 00:55:11.235
When you are on
your last breath,

386
00:55:11.279 --> 00:55:15.235
he will find you...
or he will not.

387
00:55:17.148 --> 00:55:18.671
I am grateful.

388
00:55:21.322 --> 00:55:22.671
Thank you, sir.

389
00:55:25.235 --> 00:55:28.061
Perhaps you were not
listening before.

390
00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:33.322
The social contract.

391
00:55:34.627 --> 00:55:36.192
The commerce of relationships.

392
00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:39.713
You have received a great gift.

393
00:55:39.757 --> 00:55:41.061
I have hosted your friend.

394
00:55:42.192 --> 00:55:44.018
What do you offer in return?

395
00:55:48.366 --> 00:55:50.974
So soft and yet so fierce.

396
00:55:52.018 --> 00:55:54.018
I love it, this dog.

397
00:55:55.627 --> 00:55:56.844
I will keep it.

398
00:55:56.887 --> 00:55:58.148
Excuse me?

399
00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.931
This will be my gift.

400
00:55:59.974 --> 00:56:02.540
This will be how you
show me your fealty.

401
00:56:02.584 --> 00:56:03.844
No.

402
00:56:03.887 --> 00:56:06.148
Surely it's the
least you can do.

403
00:56:06.192 --> 00:56:08.148
No, you cannot keep my dog.

404
00:56:09.279 --> 00:56:10.670
Very well.

405
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.235
Very well.

406
00:56:15.584 --> 00:56:17.018
Then I will kill it.

407
00:56:22.192 --> 00:56:24.105
I'm sorry, Sofia.

408
00:56:24.148 --> 00:56:26.322
This was for you to learn.

409
00:56:34.844 --> 00:56:35.974
Don't.

410
00:57:17.584 --> 00:57:19.757
Sofia. Don't.

411
00:57:24.713 --> 00:57:26.626
He shot my dog.

412
00:57:27.974 --> 00:57:29.453
I get it.

413
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.844
We gotta go. Now.

414
01:04:09.148 --> 01:04:10.539
Here you go.

415
01:04:15.148 --> 01:04:17.844
You're gonna die, John.

416
01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:23.626
Whether out here in this desert,
or somewhere else down the road.

417
01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:27.105
But you <i>are</i> gonna die.

418
01:04:42.452 --> 01:04:44.147
Consequences.

419
01:04:48.105 --> 01:04:49.539
Consequences.

420
01:05:16.408 --> 01:05:17.974
Better get going.

421
01:05:27.321 --> 01:05:28.626
Sofia.

422
01:08:09.539 --> 01:08:11.365
Okay.

423
01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.321
You made your point.

424
01:08:19.844 --> 01:08:21.670
You have earned my fealty.

425
01:08:22.756 --> 01:08:24.060
Matter of fact...

426
01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:25.886
I'm gonna shove so
much fealty up your ass

427
01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:27.712
it's gonna come spilling
out of your mouth.

428
01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:29.930
You had your chance.

429
01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:35.189
Well, since you see it that way,
I guess it's time I told you

430
01:08:35.191 --> 01:08:39.147
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

431
01:08:39.191 --> 01:08:41.147
Duly noted.

432
01:08:41.191 --> 01:08:42.886
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

433
01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:46.712
your penance will be
paid with seven cuts.

434
01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:49.408
Well, sometimes you
gotta cut a motherfucker.

435
01:08:53.191 --> 01:08:55.496
Avert your eyes, my sweet.

436
01:08:56.408 --> 01:08:59.321
The king is dead.

437
01:09:04.278 --> 01:09:06.191
Long live the king.

438
01:09:59.973 --> 01:10:01.191
Drink.

439
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.886
Don't worry, your weapon is still there.
Please drink.

440
01:10:17.321 --> 01:10:21.408
My son,
how have you come to be so lost?

441
01:10:21.452 --> 01:10:22.757
Not lost.

442
01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.452
Looking for you.

443
01:10:25.496 --> 01:10:27.930
You think I speak
of your location?

444
01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:33.452
Never seen a man fight so hard
to end up back where he started.

445
01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:43.191
So tell me, Jonathan.

446
01:10:43.234 --> 01:10:45.191
Why do you wish to live?

447
01:10:45.843 --> 01:10:49.191
My wife, Helen.

448
01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:56.583
To remember her. To remember us.

449
01:10:56.626 --> 01:10:59.408
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

450
01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.321
At least a chance to earn it.

451
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:09.234
I can give you one last
chance to earn a life.

452
01:11:09.278 --> 01:11:11.365
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

453
01:11:13.017 --> 01:11:16.973
Complete a task for us and your
Excommunicado will be reversed.

454
01:11:17.017 --> 01:11:19.234
The open contract closed,

455
01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:21.321
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

456
01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:24.452
Not free under the
Table but bound to it.

457
01:11:24.496 --> 01:11:27.496
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

458
01:11:31.799 --> 01:11:33.321
The choice is yours.

459
01:11:35.452 --> 01:11:37.670
Die here and now.

460
01:11:37.713 --> 01:11:40.670
Or continue to live and
remember through death.

461
01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.104
What must be done?

462
01:12:00.147 --> 01:12:03.234
The cost of your life will
be the death of others.

463
01:12:03.278 --> 01:12:05.886
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

464
01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:08.147
What?

465
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:10.886
He has forgotten his fealty.

466
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:13.496
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

467
01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:16.104
will be lifted until
you complete your task.

468
01:12:16.886 --> 01:12:21.539
So if you wish to live and
if you wish to remember,

469
01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:23.365
this is the choice
you must make.

470
01:12:40.278 --> 01:12:42.278
I will serve.

471
01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:47.408
I will be of service.

472
01:12:47.452 --> 01:12:49.539
Very well, my son.

473
01:12:49.583 --> 01:12:51.539
Cast aside your weakness

474
01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:54.408
and reaffirm your
fealty to the Table.

475
01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:01.886
Mr. John Wick.

476
01:13:49.756 --> 01:13:51.191
Thank you.

477
01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:56.365
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

478
01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:16.452
I wish you good
luck on your path.

479
01:14:16.496 --> 01:14:19.234
Zahir will help you
prepare for your departure.

480
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:22.147
And Mr. Wick.

481
01:15:01.712 --> 01:15:05.060
JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.

482
01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:08.017
JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.

483
01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:32.408
Stick together, kids.

484
01:16:39.104 --> 01:16:42.495
You see? That's why you're
special, John Wick.

485
01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:47.495
I wouldn't have stopped.

486
01:16:48.843 --> 01:16:50.495
It's good to have you back.

487
01:16:57.365 --> 01:16:59.147
How was your trip?

488
01:17:01.799 --> 01:17:03.799
Going to the Continental?

489
01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:11.669
He with you?

490
01:17:11.712 --> 01:17:14.060
He was.

491
01:17:24.278 --> 01:17:25.799
Nice trick.

492
01:20:33.191 --> 01:20:35.799
Sir! Put your weapon down.

493
01:20:37.407 --> 01:20:40.060
He's Excommunicado.

494
01:20:40.104 --> 01:20:42.451
Unless you wish to
become the same...

495
01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:46.799
I suggest you lower your gun.

496
01:20:52.799 --> 01:20:54.843
I'd like to see the manager.

497
01:20:57.277 --> 01:20:59.364
Of course.

498
01:20:59.407 --> 01:21:02.017
If you would be so
kind as to follow me.

499
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.712
Please take a seat.

500
01:21:16.756 --> 01:21:18.973
I will let him know
you have arrived.

501
01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:55.277
I gotta tell you.

502
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.407
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

503
01:21:58.451 --> 01:22:01.495
I'm a huge fan, John Wick.

504
01:22:03.712 --> 01:22:06.712
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

505
01:22:10.233 --> 01:22:12.407
Is that <i>the</i> dog?

506
01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:14.669
He likes you.

507
01:22:14.712 --> 01:22:19.017
Me? I'm more of a
cat person myself.

508
01:22:19.538 --> 01:22:21.146
Hey, dog.

509
01:22:24.146 --> 01:22:28.320
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

510
01:22:28.364 --> 01:22:30.538
We're not the same.

511
01:22:30.582 --> 01:22:31.973
Yes, we are.

512
01:22:32.756 --> 01:22:34.572
No, we're not.

513
01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:37.973
The manager is
ready for you now.

514
01:22:38.017 --> 01:22:39.712
In the administrative
lounge, sir.

515
01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:55.886
Mr. Wick.

516
01:22:58.059 --> 01:22:59.103
Sit.

517
01:23:00.495 --> 01:23:01.799
Stay.

518
01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:04.320
Good dog.

519
01:24:00.364 --> 01:24:02.669
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

520
01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:14.712
We only use this room
on special occasions.

521
01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:18.799
When you simply <i>have</i> to see
what your opponent is holding

522
01:24:18.843 --> 01:24:20.407
under the table.

523
01:24:22.364 --> 01:24:24.495
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

524
01:24:25.582 --> 01:24:26.843
Yeah.

525
01:24:26.886 --> 01:24:28.460
Well, of course.

526
01:24:29.103 --> 01:24:33.451
They sent men to kill <i>you</i>
and now you to kill <i>me</i>.

527
01:24:34.582 --> 01:24:36.582
Isn't that why you're here?

528
01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:41.277
I have served,
I will be of service.

529
01:24:43.277 --> 01:24:45.278
But you're having doubts.

530
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.016
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

531
01:24:50.059 --> 01:24:52.016
If you feel you must...

532
01:24:54.538 --> 01:24:56.712
put a bullet through my heart.

533
01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.799
The High Table has
asked me to step down.

534
01:25:05.843 --> 01:25:07.320
The hour?

535
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:09.277
The hour.

536
01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.495
You should have killed
me in the Continental.

537
01:25:12.712 --> 01:25:15.103
Maybe I should have.

538
01:25:15.146 --> 01:25:17.669
Rules and consequences.

539
01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.756
It seems like
everyone is suffering

540
01:25:20.799 --> 01:25:23.233
from the consequences
of their actions.

541
01:25:23.277 --> 01:25:25.538
And you're not stepping down?

542
01:25:27.582 --> 01:25:28.972
No.

543
01:25:29.929 --> 01:25:31.686
I don't think I am.

544
01:25:31.929 --> 01:25:33.730
So it's war?

545
01:25:33.972 --> 01:25:36.146
You're going to war
with the High Table?

546
01:25:36.886 --> 01:25:38.277
Skirmish.

547
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.712
Unless you decide to shoot me.

548
01:25:39.756 --> 01:25:43.088
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend...

549
01:25:43.843 --> 01:25:44.948
than that of an enemy.

550
01:25:46.495 --> 01:25:49.190
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

551
01:25:50.843 --> 01:25:53.059
What choice?

552
01:25:53.103 --> 01:25:55.885
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

553
01:25:55.929 --> 01:26:00.103
But I'll be alive and
I can remember her.

554
01:26:00.146 --> 01:26:02.885
Until you die as a
servant of the High Table.

555
01:26:02.929 --> 01:26:07.538
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

556
01:26:07.582 --> 01:26:10.929
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

557
01:26:10.972 --> 01:26:14.929
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

558
01:26:15.495 --> 01:26:17.233
The Baba Yaga?

559
01:26:17.277 --> 01:26:19.407
The last thing
many men ever see?

560
01:26:19.451 --> 01:26:24.407
Or as a man who loved and
was loved by his wife?

561
01:26:24.451 --> 01:26:27.059
Who do you wish to die
as, Jonathan?

562
01:26:59.277 --> 01:27:02.146
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

563
01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:03.799
I am an Adjudicator.

564
01:27:05.364 --> 01:27:07.103
Have you decided to step down?

565
01:27:09.712 --> 01:27:11.093
I think not.

566
01:27:12.582 --> 01:27:15.625
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

567
01:27:19.016 --> 01:27:22.146
No, I don't think I will.

568
01:27:29.885 --> 01:27:31.190
Very well.

569
01:27:39.538 --> 01:27:41.190
Administration.

570
01:27:41.233 --> 01:27:43.233
I'd like to change
a designation.

571
01:27:44.059 --> 01:27:45.233
Verification?

572
01:27:45.277 --> 01:27:48.538
Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.

573
01:27:48.582 --> 01:27:50.582
The Continental Hotel, New York.

574
01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:52.538
New designation?

575
01:27:52.582 --> 01:27:53.972
Deconsecrated.

576
01:27:56.755 --> 01:27:57.755
Processing.

577
01:28:00.277 --> 01:28:01.407
Administrator.

578
01:28:02.798 --> 01:28:06.929
File.
The New York Continental Hotel.

579
01:28:17.495 --> 01:28:21.842
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

580
01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:31.669
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

581
01:28:31.712 --> 01:28:34.495
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

582
01:28:34.538 --> 01:28:37.081
Since you are refusing
to step down and you are

583
01:28:37.082 --> 01:28:41.146
refusing a direct order,
your lives are now forfeit.

584
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:43.363
High Table emissaries will
be joining you presently

585
01:28:43.364 --> 01:28:45.972
to see the removal of your
souls from the property.

586
01:28:47.233 --> 01:28:49.233
Good evening, gentlemen.

587
01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.538
This haven is safe no more.

588
01:28:59.451 --> 01:29:02.146
Are services still
off limits to me?

589
01:29:02.929 --> 01:29:04.277
Under the circumstances,

590
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.364
your privileges are
reinstated immediately.

591
01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:07.755
What do you need?

592
01:29:08.407 --> 01:29:11.515
Guns. Lots of guns.

593
01:29:29.842 --> 01:29:31.842
Let's make a withdrawal.

594
01:29:55.972 --> 01:29:57.451
Remember, sir.

595
01:29:57.495 --> 01:29:59.842
These will be High Table forces.

596
01:29:59.885 --> 01:30:02.364
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

597
01:30:02.972 --> 01:30:04.233
Why?

598
01:30:04.277 --> 01:30:05.929
Much has changed
during your time away.

599
01:30:06.711 --> 01:30:08.103
Like what?

600
01:30:08.146 --> 01:30:10.755
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

601
01:30:18.755 --> 01:30:22.668
May I suggest the
2011 Combat Master

602
01:30:22.711 --> 01:30:25.016
in combination with the
nine millimeter major.

603
01:30:36.582 --> 01:30:38.320
Attention, all guests.

604
01:30:38.364 --> 01:30:41.755
The Continental Hotel is
closing for fumigation.

605
01:30:41.798 --> 01:30:43.538
We apologize for
the inconvenience.

606
01:30:43.582 --> 01:30:45.538
Please make your way
to the nearest exit.

607
01:30:53.103 --> 01:30:56.668
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

608
01:30:56.711 --> 01:30:59.789
Your transaction may now be
conducted on Continental grounds.

609
01:31:05.842 --> 01:31:09.059
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

610
01:31:09.103 --> 01:31:12.059
Cool. Very cool.

611
01:31:16.885 --> 01:31:21.711
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

612
01:31:21.755 --> 01:31:23.624
Serious business.

613
01:31:26.885 --> 01:31:28.320
Thank you.

614
01:31:28.364 --> 01:31:29.929
Let us begin.

615
01:33:16.233 --> 01:33:19.059
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

616
01:33:19.929 --> 01:33:21.537
Of course, sir.

617
01:33:42.711 --> 01:33:45.537
I know you'll do the
Continental proud.

618
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:47.146
I'll see you soon, sir.

619
01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:53.711
And you Jonathan,
do what you do best.

620
01:33:53.755 --> 01:33:54.972
What's that?

621
01:33:55.624 --> 01:33:57.146
Hunt.

622
01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:33.711
Winston! Winston!

623
01:37:37.798 --> 01:37:40.319
I need more firepower.

624
01:38:03.016 --> 01:38:04.929
Armor improvements.

625
01:38:04.972 --> 01:38:08.016
12-Gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

626
01:41:35.276 --> 01:41:37.363
Only by my sword, John.

627
01:41:49.494 --> 01:41:51.755
I know you believe
you can keep this up.

628
01:41:51.798 --> 01:41:53.015
But I assure you...

629
01:49:57.754 --> 01:50:00.449
John, you're incredible.

630
01:50:01.363 --> 01:50:02.449
Exhausted...

631
01:50:02.928 --> 01:50:04.797
outnumbered...

632
01:50:04.841 --> 01:50:06.232
obviously in pain.

633
01:50:07.493 --> 01:50:10.015
And you still beat
all of my students.

634
01:50:10.058 --> 01:50:11.928
If I didn't have to kill you...

635
01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:14.971
we'd be pals.

636
01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:17.102
Let's do this.

637
01:50:44.797 --> 01:50:47.449
See? We're the same.

638
01:54:33.884 --> 01:54:36.536
I would like to
suggest a parley.

639
01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:38.231
A parley would be good.

640
01:54:38.275 --> 01:54:39.580
Very well.

641
01:54:50.754 --> 01:54:52.449
Are we in play, sir?

642
01:54:54.102 --> 01:54:55.449
Oh, very much so.

643
01:55:14.928 --> 01:55:16.536
Hey, John.

644
01:55:18.841 --> 01:55:21.275
That was a pretty good
fight, huh?

645
01:55:25.101 --> 01:55:26.362
Yeah.

646
01:55:55.841 --> 01:55:57.754
Yeah.

647
01:55:57.797 --> 01:56:01.362
Don't worry about me, John.

648
01:56:01.405 --> 01:56:03.493
I just gotta catch my breath.

649
01:56:05.405 --> 01:56:07.058
I'll catch up to you, John.

650
01:56:12.318 --> 01:56:14.231
No, you won't.

651
01:56:24.797 --> 01:56:28.188
You gentlemen, of course
realize that was the <i>first</i> wave.

652
01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:30.710
Merely an amuse-bouche.

653
01:56:30.754 --> 01:56:32.405
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

654
01:56:32.449 --> 01:56:34.144
but it only ends one way.

655
01:56:34.188 --> 01:56:36.710
Are you sure a protracted
war is the best way forward?

656
01:56:36.754 --> 01:56:39.057
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

657
01:56:39.101 --> 01:56:41.710
Oh, you can take the Continental,
I have no doubt about that.

658
01:56:41.754 --> 01:56:43.971
But keeping it,
that's a different matter entirely.

659
01:56:44.015 --> 01:56:47.188
My allegiances run way
beyond this building.

660
01:56:48.057 --> 01:56:49.667
We are High Table.

661
01:56:50.318 --> 01:56:51.580
And we...

662
01:56:52.754 --> 01:56:54.493
are New York City.

663
01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.188
Are we negotiating?

664
01:57:00.928 --> 01:57:02.362
I believe we are.

665
01:57:08.057 --> 01:57:09.057
Parley?

666
01:57:09.971 --> 01:57:11.318
Parley.

667
01:57:14.841 --> 01:57:16.971
What do you propose we do?

668
01:57:21.144 --> 01:57:23.057
Let me keep my power.

669
01:57:23.623 --> 01:57:24.754
Under the Table.

670
01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:32.275
I have served and been a
beacon of order and stability

671
01:57:32.318 --> 01:57:34.449
to our industry for
over forty years.

672
01:57:34.493 --> 01:57:37.127
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped and

673
01:57:37.128 --> 01:57:39.841
re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

674
01:57:42.275 --> 01:57:43.754
Winston.

675
01:57:49.405 --> 01:57:51.014
You were merely showing strength

676
01:57:51.057 --> 01:57:53.536
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

677
01:57:57.188 --> 01:58:00.101
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

678
01:58:01.449 --> 01:58:02.754
But what about him?

679
01:58:04.928 --> 01:58:08.493
What are we going to
do about John Wick?

680
01:58:13.928 --> 01:58:15.623
He has to die.

681
01:58:17.188 --> 01:58:19.057
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

682
01:58:19.101 --> 01:58:20.405
Don't see any other way.

683
01:58:32.231 --> 01:58:34.014
Very well, gentlemen.

684
01:58:34.057 --> 01:58:37.318
The Continental will
now be reconsecrated.

685
01:58:38.275 --> 01:58:40.101
Good day to you both.

686
01:58:44.144 --> 01:58:45.754
Well played, sir.

687
01:59:21.101 --> 01:59:24.057
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

688
01:59:24.101 --> 01:59:25.797
Should be no time at all.

689
01:59:29.797 --> 01:59:31.623
Mr. Wick is gone.

690
01:59:31.667 --> 01:59:33.015
A true tragedy.

691
01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:34.658
You misunderstand.

692
01:59:35.014 --> 01:59:36.988
I mean that he is no
longer on the street.

693
01:59:38.014 --> 01:59:39.084
That seems improbable.

694
01:59:39.231 --> 01:59:40.479
And yet, true.

695
01:59:42.536 --> 01:59:44.883
I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.

696
01:59:44.927 --> 01:59:46.545
Both from above and below.

697
01:59:47.275 --> 01:59:48.883
The last thing either
one of us needs

698
01:59:48.927 --> 01:59:51.231
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

699
01:59:54.101 --> 01:59:56.101
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

700
01:59:56.144 --> 01:59:58.449
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

701
01:59:58.493 --> 02:00:02.101
Absolutely. How far can he get?

702
02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:15.275
Baba Yaga.

703
02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.052
How you doing, John?

704
02:00:49.014 --> 02:00:51.263
You look as bad as I feel.

705
02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.362
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

706
02:00:56.405 --> 02:00:58.225
Raise a hand if you can hear
me, John.

707
02:01:01.493 --> 02:01:03.961
Oh, shit. They took a finger.

708
02:01:04.405 --> 02:01:05.623
Ain't that a bitch?

709
02:01:12.449 --> 02:01:15.470
John fucking Wick.

710
02:01:16.449 --> 02:01:20.536
So, the old boy keeps his
hotel and you take the fall.

711
02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:21.369
Can't say I blame him.

712
02:01:21.371 --> 02:01:24.101
I would've done the same
thing if I was in his shoes.

713
02:01:25.014 --> 02:01:27.330
But this High Table shit.

714
02:01:30.710 --> 02:01:32.181
Seven cuts.

715
02:01:36.014 --> 02:01:38.266
Under the Table is
where shit gets done.

716
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:43.536
And they're about to find
out, if you cut a king,

717
