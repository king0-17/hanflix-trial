1
00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.000
- Inhale your
arms above your head.

2
00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.448
Exhale your hands into
prayer at your heart

3
00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.000
and begin to rub
those palms together.

4
00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:40.310
Thank yourself for taking
the time to align your mind,

5
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.068
body, heart, and soul.

6
00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.000
Namaste.

7
00:00:49.137 --> 00:00:51.000
- What the hell?

8
00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:20.896
What the fuck?

9
00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:47.931
Why am I here?

10
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:48.896
Why am I here?

11
00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:50.206
Help me.

12
00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:51.724
Hey, hey, you got the,
you got the wrong guy.

13
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:53.379
You got the wrong
guy, I promise,

14
00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.689
it wasn't me.

15
00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.689
Whatever you think
I did, I didn't do.

16
00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.931
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

17
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.758
Please.

18
00:02:02.827 --> 00:02:04.310
What is that for,
what is that for?

19
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.172
Please, please,
please, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:09.482
Man, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:21.379
Please, please, please, please.

22
00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:40.551
- And we're back

23
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:42.655
on the weekly "Murder
They Wrote" podcast

24
00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.379
where we break down some of
the grizzliest serial killers

25
00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.586
this side of the
Mississippi river.

26
00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:48.758
- Well, we
do talk both sides.

27
00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:50.551
- What have I told you
about interrupting my intro?

28
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:52.551
- That it raises
our listening base,

29
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:53.758
that I should do it more often?

30
00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:56.068
- No,
exactly the opposite.

31
00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.068
Anyway, this month
we've been focusing on

32
00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:01.482
the gruesome history of the
illustrious Mechanic Maniac.

33
00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:05.241
- Mm, I still like
scroll saw slasher much better.

34
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:08.103
- Which would make
sense if he used a scroll saw.

35
00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:09.724
But since he doesn't.

36
00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:11.137
- Well, I mean,

37
00:04:11.137 --> 00:04:12.379
how do you know he
doesn't use a scroll saw?

38
00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.862
- Okay, where
in all of the evidence,

39
00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:14.931
where does this say that?

40
00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:16.103
- Huh?

41
00:04:16.103 --> 00:04:17.379
- Well, a
scroll saw doesn't move.

42
00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.034
It's like on a table.

43
00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:20.551
How would you?

44
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:22.758
- I'm just saying
he could, okay.

45
00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:24.724
And how do we even
know he's a he?

46
00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:26.275
- Like we've been
talking about, right.

47
00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:29.379
I mean, the police only have
minimal evidence as it is.

48
00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:30.586
It's it's been what?

49
00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:32.931
Nearly 10 years and
13 known victims

50
00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:36.103
with no arrests and
really no suspect.

51
00:04:48.862 --> 00:04:50.448
- Sex on the beach.

52
00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:53.931
- I definitely didn't
order sex on the beach.

53
00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:58.862
- It's worth a shot.

54
00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:11.000
You ever tried one?

55
00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.655
- I think I'm
good with this one.

56
00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:15.103
- Oh, come on, it tastes good.

57
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:19.482
- Here you go, honey.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:24.000
- You come around here often?

59
00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:27.655
- Just passing through.

60
00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:28.517
- Oh, come on now.

61
00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:30.034
You can't lie to me.

62
00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:30.862
I know better.

63
00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:33.655
I've seen you before.

64
00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:35.275
- Seriously doubt that.

65
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:36.448
- You ever tasted this?

66
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.137
I can tell you you haven't.

67
00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:41.689
It's good.

68
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:42.793
- You should enjoy it.

69
00:05:43.793 --> 00:05:45.137
- It's better with company.

70
00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.344
- You have a good night.

71
00:05:49.862 --> 00:05:51.827
- If you like to get pushy,

72
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:54.517
I like that too.

73
00:05:57.448 --> 00:05:58.241
- Clearly.

74
00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:04.758
- Not your type?

75
00:06:06.758 --> 00:06:07.655
- Not even close.

76
00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:12.758
- Hey, how's that salad?

77
00:06:12.758 --> 00:06:14.275
- Surprisingly delicious.

78
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:15.241
- Really?

79
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.068
I wouldn't have expected that.

80
00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:17.241
- I know, right?

81
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.275
I'm guessing we close
to all the farms

82
00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:19.586
so the produce is fresh.

83
00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:21.482
- That makes sense.

84
00:06:21.482 --> 00:06:23.034
I'm Dawn.

85
00:06:23.034 --> 00:06:23.862
- Micah.

86
00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:27.275
- So you see
anything good on there?

87
00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:28.551
- You know what?

88
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:30.103
Think I'm gonna have
what he's having.

89
00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:32.172
That'd be great, thank you.

90
00:06:32.172 --> 00:06:34.068
Whisky and coke too?

91
00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:35.379
- Okay, seriously.

92
00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.206
That's my go to.

93
00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:38.758
- Well make that two then.

94
00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:40.413
Put hers on my tab.

95
00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:41.241
- You got it.

96
00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:44.103
- Why thank you, sir.

97
00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:44.931
- No worries.

98
00:06:46.413 --> 00:06:49.931
So what brings you to the
middle of bum-fuck California?

99
00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:52.000
- Just road-tripping
from LA to Portland.

100
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.103
- Oh yeah?

101
00:06:53.103 --> 00:06:54.103
What's up there?

102
00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:54.931
- Soak.

103
00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:57.689
- Soak?

104
00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:00.379
- Soak, the massive festival.

105
00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.655
It's like the burning
man in Oregon,

106
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.931
camping, arts, music,

107
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:06.310
all of that kind of stuff.

108
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.172
- Okay.

109
00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:08.137
It sounds cool.

110
00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:09.275
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

111
00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:11.172
It gets kind of crazy though.

112
00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:13.172
I'm guessing that
you've never been.

113
00:07:13.172 --> 00:07:14.655
- To soak?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:14.655 --> 00:07:15.655
- No.

115
00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:17.724
Or burning man for that matter.

116
00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:21.310
- Well, I think you
definitely gotta check it out.

117
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.965
- So you driving up alone?

118
00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.000
- Yeah.

119
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.310
It's just me and my van.

120
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.931
I actually built it so
that I can pretty much

121
00:07:27.931 --> 00:07:29.655
just like live on the road.

122
00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:32.172
I am obsessed with traveling.

123
00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:33.000
- Yeah?

124
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.103
That's interesting.

125
00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:35.689
I enjoy traveling myself.

126
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.758
I've been making my
way around the Midwest,

127
00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.275
hitting up all the
national parks.

128
00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:41.758
- You know, nothing
beats in open road.

129
00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:43.758
- I actually have
family in Portland

130
00:07:43.758 --> 00:07:45.482
I've been mean in
the visit soon.

131
00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:46.896
- Okay, I love Portland too.

132
00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:49.448
Do you like go
often or anything?

133
00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:51.172
- Yeah, but plans
got put on hold

134
00:07:51.172 --> 00:07:53.517
because my truck is in the shop.

135
00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:55.482
So stuck here for a bit.

136
00:07:55.482 --> 00:07:57.379
- Well, that's a bummer.

137
00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:58.758
- Bottoms up.

138
00:07:58.758 --> 00:08:00.103
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:05.000
- Well, two adventures
on the road.

140
00:08:06.517 --> 00:08:08.310
- Cheers to the art
are falling apart

141
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.344
for those of us
who do it so well.

142
00:08:10.344 --> 00:08:12.000
Cheers to myself and another

143
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.172
and made that other be she

144
00:08:13.172 --> 00:08:15.793
who drinks to
herself and another

145
00:08:15.793 --> 00:08:17.551
and made that other be me.

146
00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:18.551
Cheers.

147
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:19.551
- Wow.

148
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:21.310
Very nice sir.

149
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.137
- So he ain't the entire cake.

150
00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.241
- Well, it was a
social media challenge.

151
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:29.241
- What?
- Just say no,

152
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:30.379
his whole face was like.

153
00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:32.965
- Hey guys,
we're about to wrap it up.

154
00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:35.172
Can I get you anything else?

155
00:08:35.172 --> 00:08:36.413
- I'm good.

156
00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:38.309
I've got a long
drive ahead of me.

157
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.344
- Just the check.

158
00:08:39.344 --> 00:08:40.309
Thank you.

159
00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.206
- You got it buddy.

160
00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:42.206
- Oh, my god.

161
00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:43.000
- Well,

162
00:08:44.172 --> 00:08:47.689
that was quite an
unexpected encounter.

163
00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:49.241
- Likewise.

164
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.655
I haven't had a conversation
this enjoyed one in a while.

165
00:08:53.034 --> 00:08:54.379
- You know what,

166
00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:55.793
you should just come with me.

167
00:08:57.724 --> 00:08:59.241
- What?

168
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:00.586
- I'll give you a lip to
see your family in Portland.

169
00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:01.413
No problem.

170
00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:03.689
- No, I couldn't impose.
- Look,

171
00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:04.517
look,

172
00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:06.172
it's a done deal.

173
00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:09.413
First let's take a selfie so
we can remember this moment.

174
00:09:09.413 --> 00:09:11.310
- Here, let me.

175
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.620
Oh shit, fuck.
- Shit.

176
00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:17.965
- No, no.
- I think it's fried.

177
00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:22.586
- I am so sorry.

178
00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:26.896
You know what?

179
00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:28.482
I'll ride with you to Portland

180
00:09:28.482 --> 00:09:31.206
only to get you a new
phone when we get there,

181
00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:32.793
top of the line,

182
00:09:32.793 --> 00:09:34.413
whatever's available.

183
00:09:34.413 --> 00:09:38.551
- I mean, you can't say
no to top of the line

184
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.586
and waterproof would be nice.

185
00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:42.620
- You got it.

186
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.931
- Okay, deal.

187
00:09:45.827 --> 00:09:47.068
I feel like this is
like my first time

188
00:09:47.068 --> 00:09:49.241
having someone ride
with me on a road trip.

189
00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:50.413
- Yeah?

190
00:09:50.413 --> 00:09:51.655
Feels special.

191
00:09:51.655 --> 00:09:53.379
- But you can also
keep me awake.

192
00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:54.793
- I have a job.

193
00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:56.034
- Ooh.
- Oh.

194
00:09:56.034 --> 00:09:56.965
- Sorry.

195
00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:58.103
- You okay?
- Yeah.

196
00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:00.137
I'm good, I'm good.

197
00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:01.551
- Wow.

198
00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:03.551
- This is my baby.

199
00:10:05.724 --> 00:10:06.793
You like it?

200
00:10:06.793 --> 00:10:08.862
Check it out, check it out.

201
00:10:10.103 --> 00:10:10.931
- All right.

202
00:10:29.482 --> 00:10:31.655
So where are you
from originally?

203
00:10:31.655 --> 00:10:33.758
- I grew up in the
Midwest, Wisconsin.

204
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.034
I was raised by a single father.

205
00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.551
Taught me how to hunt.

206
00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:40.793
I slung malts at the dairy
bar, yada yada, yada.

207
00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:41.620
- Living the dream.

208
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.034
- Exactly.

209
00:10:43.034 --> 00:10:44.310
What about you?

210
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.931
What's your life story buddy?

211
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.241
- Definitely not as amazing.

212
00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:52.103
I grew up in Chicago and
I had a rough childhood.

213
00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:53.965
Didn't go to college,

214
00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:55.620
not much family to speak of.

215
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.241
- Except for the
ones in Portland?

216
00:10:58.137 --> 00:10:58.965
- Yeah, right.

217
00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:03.275
Kinda wanted to turn over
new leaf there, you know.

218
00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:04.586
Start over.

219
00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:06.137
- I get that.

220
00:11:06.137 --> 00:11:09.793
I believe that everyone
deserves a second chance.

221
00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:11.172
- Exactly.

222
00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:17.896
- Excuse me.

223
00:11:17.896 --> 00:11:20.655
I think I'm gonna have
to pull over pretty soon.

224
00:11:20.655 --> 00:11:22.586
- What, you need me to drive?

225
00:11:22.586 --> 00:11:25.275
- Oh, no.

226
00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:27.310
Nobody drives Emily but me.

227
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.448
We can just find a
place to pull off

228
00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:30.275
and we can camp for the night.

229
00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:31.206
Got a bed in the back.

230
00:11:31.206 --> 00:11:33.310
And I'll set you up in hammock.

231
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.793
- Just sleep on the
side of the road?

232
00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:37.724
- Yeah, I do it all the time

233
00:11:37.724 --> 00:11:39.827
and it's quieter
than truck stops.

234
00:12:02.827 --> 00:12:04.241
Okay, this'll do.

235
00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:08.172
- You sure this shit is cool?

236
00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:11.068
- There's nobody
anywhere around here

237
00:12:12.241 --> 00:12:14.758
unless you're
afraid of the dark.

238
00:12:17.448 --> 00:12:19.000
- I'm sure I can handle it.

239
00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:22.068
- Here you go.

240
00:12:24.103 --> 00:12:25.448
- Perfect.

241
00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:26.724
Actually, haven't been
camping in a while.

242
00:12:26.724 --> 00:12:28.724
- Well, it's just
like riding a bike

243
00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:31.000
except we're in nature,
and you're asleep.

244
00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:33.068
- I guess.

245
00:12:35.517 --> 00:12:37.275
- I must say I'm a little ripe.

246
00:12:37.275 --> 00:12:39.103
I'm gonna go shower
if you don't mind.

247
00:12:39.103 --> 00:12:40.689
- You got a shower
in that thing too?

248
00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:41.896
- Yeah, a camp shower.

249
00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.689
I just refill the water
tank every few days.

250
00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:47.413
- Damn, that
shit ball as hell.

251
00:12:47.413 --> 00:12:48.275
- Thank you.

252
00:12:48.275 --> 00:12:50.000
I designed it myself.

253
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.758
And

254
00:12:52.068 --> 00:12:52.862
check this out.

255
00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:57.586
Now we have some tunage.

256
00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:59.586
- I'm digging it.

257
00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:00.482
- Okay.

258
00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:05.482
You mind giving me
a little privacy?

259
00:13:05.482 --> 00:13:07.724
- Oh, absolutely, I'm sorry.

260
00:13:08.827 --> 00:13:09.655
- Hey Micah.

261
00:13:11.137 --> 00:13:13.448
You wanna grab us some wood
so we can make a little fire?

262
00:13:13.448 --> 00:13:16.000
You do know what kindling
is, right, city boy?

263
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.310
- Stop it.

264
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.310
I watch a lot of
documentaries in my downtime.

265
00:13:20.896 --> 00:13:22.965
It's the little stickies, right?

266
00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:23.827
- Yes.

267
00:13:23.827 --> 00:13:24.724
Very good.

268
00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:26.172
Just little stickies.

269
00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.413
There's gonna be a
headlamp up there.

270
00:13:28.413 --> 00:13:31.655
And it's a rape whistle for
if you're really worried.

271
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.137
Micah?

272
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.896
Micah is that you?

273
00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:24.482
Micah?

274
00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:27.379
Micah, come on, where are you?

275
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:29.551
Micah, what the hell?

276
00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:32.965
Micah?

277
00:14:32.965 --> 00:14:34.172
- What's up?

278
00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:35.000
- Jesus.

279
00:14:37.068 --> 00:14:38.206
What the hell was that?

280
00:14:40.275 --> 00:14:41.103
- What?

281
00:14:42.034 --> 00:14:42.896
The lights?

282
00:14:44.068 --> 00:14:45.379
- Where did you run off to?

283
00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:48.793
- I went to go get some
wood and to take a piss.

284
00:14:50.241 --> 00:14:53.172
- Some dude in a Bronco
was parked over there.

285
00:14:53.172 --> 00:14:55.344
He just took off.

286
00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:58.068
- I definitely thought
I heard something.

287
00:14:58.068 --> 00:14:59.344
- I don't know
how you missed it.

288
00:14:59.344 --> 00:15:02.206
- Well, I told you this
place might not be safe.

289
00:15:02.206 --> 00:15:03.379
- So weird.

290
00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.620
- They probably was
just some local farm boy

291
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.793
trying to sneak a peak.

292
00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:11.724
- Creepers.

293
00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:14.931
- Yeah, they're everywhere.

294
00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:25.206
- I'm gonna go get dressed.

295
00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:27.862
- Good idea.

296
00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:34.965
- Night cap?

297
00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:39.275
- I do have a motto of never
turning down a free drink.

298
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.620
- There you go, sir.

299
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.448
- Thank you.

300
00:15:42.448 --> 00:15:43.931
- You're welcome.

301
00:15:48.482 --> 00:15:50.275
You see, this is life.

302
00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:54.137
Fuck those city folks
and their traffic

303
00:15:54.137 --> 00:15:55.275
and that nasty smog.

304
00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:58.620
- It definitely could be worse.

305
00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:04.517
- Did you see where
that guy came from?

306
00:16:04.517 --> 00:16:06.034
I didn't even
notice him pull up.

307
00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:07.310
- I didn't see him at all.

308
00:16:08.448 --> 00:16:10.344
- It was creepy.

309
00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:12.206
- I'm surprised that's
never happened before,

310
00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:14.275
being single on the road.

311
00:16:14.275 --> 00:16:15.862
- Yeah.

312
00:16:15.862 --> 00:16:18.344
I mean, I guess there's a
first time for everything.

313
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:20.172
- So they say.

314
00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:28.448
- Well, think I've had enough
excitement for the night.

315
00:16:28.448 --> 00:16:29.275
- What?

316
00:16:30.517 --> 00:16:32.793
Come on, you barely took
a sip outta your drink.

317
00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:34.103
It's early.

318
00:16:34.103 --> 00:16:36.448
- Yeah, well I have a
long drive ahead of me.

319
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.206
I'm out.

320
00:16:41.758 --> 00:16:42.586
- Night then.

321
00:17:30.586 --> 00:17:34.551
♪ I like my eggs
in the morning ♪

322
00:17:36.448 --> 00:17:37.896
- Good morning, sleepy head.

323
00:17:39.413 --> 00:17:41.275
I hope you don't mind, I
found some food in you cooler.

324
00:17:41.275 --> 00:17:43.172
I made her some breakfast.

325
00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:45.068
- You rifled through my stuff?

326
00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:47.206
- I'm not sure rifled
is the word I would use.

327
00:17:47.206 --> 00:17:48.689
- Now who's the creeper?

328
00:17:50.724 --> 00:17:52.034
- Compliments of the house,

329
00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:54.034
van.

330
00:17:54.034 --> 00:17:55.379
- Thank you, monsieur

331
00:17:56.793 --> 00:17:58.344
- Not that I have a
degree in it or anything,

332
00:17:58.344 --> 00:18:00.862
but I've always demanded
a good breakfast.

333
00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:03.655
- Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

334
00:18:03.655 --> 00:18:04.482
- Absolutely.

335
00:18:07.241 --> 00:18:08.482
I must say,

336
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.275
you have quite an impressive
setup inside of that thing.

337
00:18:13.689 --> 00:18:16.310
- How about I give
you an official tour?

338
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.482
Come on.
- Okay.

339
00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:23.172
So.

340
00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:24.965
- So here we have my bed,

341
00:18:24.965 --> 00:18:26.827
which I already
put up, of course.

342
00:18:26.827 --> 00:18:29.482
And then we have
this, it's a bed,

343
00:18:29.482 --> 00:18:31.931
but it doubles as a bench.

344
00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:33.137
- Nice.

345
00:18:33.137 --> 00:18:35.172
- And then we have
the kitchen over here,

346
00:18:35.172 --> 00:18:36.689
the sink, the fridge.

347
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:38.931
This is where all of my
gourmet meals happen.

348
00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:43.172
Oh, this here is just storage.

349
00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:45.517
You know, just goods,
that kind of stuff.

350
00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:46.586
- What about that one?

351
00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:51.310
- Oh, that's just
my secret stash.

352
00:18:52.896 --> 00:18:53.724
- I got you.

353
00:18:55.275 --> 00:18:57.413
Well, I must say,

354
00:18:58.482 --> 00:19:00.344
I am very impressed.
- Thanks.

355
00:19:00.344 --> 00:19:01.586
It's a start.

356
00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:05.034
Soon, we'll be
flying into space.

357
00:19:05.034 --> 00:19:06.344
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

358
00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:08.172
Well that's my plan.

359
00:19:08.172 --> 00:19:09.551
Get rich,

360
00:19:09.551 --> 00:19:11.413
take off into space.

361
00:19:11.413 --> 00:19:12.655
That's my destiny,

362
00:19:12.655 --> 00:19:16.655
and Emily spinach here
is my first class ticket

363
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.896
to paradise.

364
00:19:17.896 --> 00:19:20.034
- That sounds like
one hell of a life.

365
00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.896
- Everything that I
own is in this van.

366
00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:22.724
It's just easy.

367
00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:24.241
You know.

368
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:25.965
- What if something
ever happened to it.

369
00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.413
- Well, I'll be here

370
00:19:27.413 --> 00:19:29.896
to make sure that nothing
ever happens to her.

371
00:19:31.482 --> 00:19:32.689
- I hope so.

372
00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:34.379
- Anyway, we should
hit the road.

373
00:19:34.379 --> 00:19:35.655
Time's a wasting.

374
00:19:35.655 --> 00:19:38.000
- Time you enjoy wasting
isn't waste of time.

375
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.551
- Is that so?

376
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:41.034
Well, we should waste time

377
00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:42.241
cleaning up your mess

378
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:44.206
and I'll go change and
we'll hit the road.

379
00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.000
Okay.

380
00:20:00.172 --> 00:20:01.000
- Woo.

381
00:20:02.896 --> 00:20:04.586
Old school, huh?

382
00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:07.896
- Well, since someone
drowned my GPS,

383
00:20:07.896 --> 00:20:10.310
luckily I always have a backup.

384
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.827
So we should be
somewhere around here.

385
00:20:13.827 --> 00:20:16.000
We'll have to stop at a
gas station around here.

386
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.172
Otherwise we'll run outta
gas before the next exit.

387
00:20:19.172 --> 00:20:21.827
The dots are for the bathrooms
just in case you gotta go.

388
00:20:21.827 --> 00:20:23.379
And if we stay on task,

389
00:20:23.379 --> 00:20:26.551
we should be to Portland at
around nine o'clock tonight.

390
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:28.034
- Wow.

391
00:20:28.034 --> 00:20:30.241
You got this whole
thing mapped out to a T.

392
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:31.827
- Well, I like to stay on task.

393
00:20:31.827 --> 00:20:33.310
You gotta take
advantage of the world

394
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.724
while we're able to, you know.

395
00:20:35.724 --> 00:20:37.241
- I guess.

396
00:20:37.241 --> 00:20:39.103
I'm not really a big
plans type of guy.

397
00:20:39.103 --> 00:20:42.655
You know, I like to let the
road take me where it takes me.

398
00:20:42.655 --> 00:20:44.206
- Huh?

399
00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:46.827
Well are ready for Emily to
take us where we gotta go?

400
00:20:46.827 --> 00:20:47.862
- Let's do it.

- I can dig that.

423
00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:32.758
I like to think of
myself as a free spirit,

424
00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:33.724
but I still got plans.

425
00:21:33.724 --> 00:21:35.275
Goals and shit.

426
00:21:35.275 --> 00:21:36.586
You fuck with goals.

427
00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:37.896
- Yeah.

428
00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:39.793
Fleeting exceptions
pop up time to time.

429
00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:44.620
I think we need some music.

430
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.620
- Like this
this guy took a circular saw

431
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.793
and cut off this girl.

432
00:21:51.793 --> 00:21:56.724
I mean talking like ankle,
knee, thigh, head fingers.

433
00:21:58.137 --> 00:21:59.310
It was just so gross.

434
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.310
- What the fuck is this?

435
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.551
- So messy.

436
00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:03.655
- Oh, it's a true crime
podcast that I love.

437
00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.103
It's called "Murder They Wrote",

438
00:22:05.103 --> 00:22:06.344
and these two are cool.

439
00:22:06.344 --> 00:22:07.793
So basically they talk
about famous murders

440
00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:09.620
across the country and just--

441
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.965
- Seriously into that shit?

442
00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:13.034
- Yeah.

443
00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:14.551
It's super interesting.

444
00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:15.517
- What do you
really think is the motive

445
00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:17.379
behind this Mechanic Maniac?

446
00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.965
- I dunno.

447
00:22:18.965 --> 00:22:21.344
He's a copycat,
wants to be famous.

448
00:22:21.344 --> 00:22:23.379
I mean, doesn't everybody
wanna be famous now.

449
00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:26.689
He wants to be some sort
of like household name,

450
00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:29.620
like a, I don't know, a Bundy,

451
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.689
or a Gacy.

452
00:22:30.689 --> 00:22:31.655
He's getting there.

453
00:22:31.655 --> 00:22:32.620
Not there yet.

454
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.827
- I don't agree.

455
00:22:33.827 --> 00:22:35.793
- Okay, I can only
take so much of that.

456
00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:39.793
- But you've heard of the
Mechanic Maniac, right?

457
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.689
- I may have heard something.

458
00:22:42.689 --> 00:22:44.517
I don't really watch those.

459
00:22:44.517 --> 00:22:47.689
- He's killed 13 victims across
five states that we know of,

460
00:22:47.689 --> 00:22:49.310
guys and girls.

461
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.103
He's never been arrested or
even close to being caught.

462
00:22:52.103 --> 00:22:54.034
He's on his way to being
the biggest serial killer

463
00:22:54.034 --> 00:22:55.827
in the past decade.

464
00:22:55.827 --> 00:22:57.103
Whew.

465
00:22:57.103 --> 00:22:58.965
- You seem a little
excited about this.

466
00:22:58.965 --> 00:23:01.068
- Well, it makes an
amazing case study.

467
00:23:01.068 --> 00:23:03.344
I had a class where we had to
use him for an assignment--

468
00:23:03.344 --> 00:23:05.275
- Look, I'm sure
he's just a weirdo

469
00:23:05.275 --> 00:23:06.620
living in his mom's basement,

470
00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.068
looking for ways
to get his kicks.

471
00:23:08.068 --> 00:23:09.275
- Not a chance.

472
00:23:09.275 --> 00:23:11.275
This guy's eluded the
FBI for almost a decade.

473
00:23:11.275 --> 00:23:12.517
It's no--
- Okay,

474
00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:14.241
so he's watched a
couple episodes of CSI

475
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:15.517
and learned a few tricks.

476
00:23:15.517 --> 00:23:16.758
Big whoop.

477
00:23:16.758 --> 00:23:17.931
Definitely not
the kind of person

478
00:23:17.931 --> 00:23:19.689
you want to put
up in a pedestal.

479
00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:21.034
- I get it.

480
00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:22.793
You're scared of
him, aren't you?

481
00:23:22.793 --> 00:23:24.827
Have you had a run in with
someone like this or something?

482
00:23:24.827 --> 00:23:26.379
- Not that I can recall.

483
00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:28.103
And I'm definitely
not scared of him.

484
00:23:28.103 --> 00:23:29.793
I'm pretty sure there's
a rational explanation

485
00:23:29.793 --> 00:23:31.689
on why he's going
after these kids.

486
00:23:31.689 --> 00:23:33.172
- Well, what do you think?

487
00:23:33.172 --> 00:23:34.586
- Think what.

488
00:23:34.586 --> 00:23:36.172
- What do you think
the motive is?

489
00:23:36.172 --> 00:23:37.896
If you follow his pattern,

490
00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:40.068
he's always trapping
a young guy or girl

491
00:23:40.068 --> 00:23:42.965
alone in a vehicle where he
takes them back to a place.

492
00:23:42.965 --> 00:23:46.413
He drugs them and he dismembers
them with a circular saw.

493
00:23:46.413 --> 00:23:47.413
What's his M.O.?

494
00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:51.379
- First off, that shit
sounds disgusting.

495
00:23:51.379 --> 00:23:53.344
And he's obviously a perv

496
00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.206
taking advantage
of someone alone.

497
00:23:55.206 --> 00:23:56.758
- He doesn't take
advantage, he just kidnaps.

498
00:23:56.758 --> 00:23:58.551
- Either way, he's a sick fuck

499
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.413
who takes his
aggressions out on randos

500
00:24:00.413 --> 00:24:02.413
and definitely should
be the front runner

501
00:24:02.413 --> 00:24:04.965
for the serial killer
of the decade award.

502
00:24:06.172 --> 00:24:07.620
- You wanna
know what I think?

503
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.827
- Enlighten me.

504
00:24:11.344 --> 00:24:13.103
- I think he's a genius,

505
00:24:13.103 --> 00:24:14.793
Harvard level craftsman.

506
00:24:15.931 --> 00:24:17.655
I think he's a master

507
00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:19.137
and I think he's
gonna keep killing

508
00:24:19.137 --> 00:24:21.620
until he finally finds the
piece that he's looking for.

509
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.655
- What the fuck, Dawn?

510
00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:29.689
I think you might wanna try
some lighter reading options

511
00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:31.586
for a bit, some Sunday
funnies or some shit.

512
00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:32.758
Turn off the history channel,

513
00:24:32.758 --> 00:24:34.586
enjoy some junk food TV.

514
00:24:34.586 --> 00:24:36.275
Jesus.

515
00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:37.206
- Come on.

516
00:24:38.517 --> 00:24:40.482
You sound jealous
of the attention.

517
00:24:40.482 --> 00:24:41.862
- The fuck that's
supposed to mean?

518
00:24:41.862 --> 00:24:42.827
Why would I be jealous
of a fucking serial?

519
00:24:42.827 --> 00:24:44.310
- I'm just kidding.

520
00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:47.172
Change the subject.

521
00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:49.206
What do you wanna talk about?

522
00:24:56.241 --> 00:24:59.655
Oh my god, I think
someone's following us.

523
00:25:01.655 --> 00:25:04.068
That's the Bronco that was
spying on me last night.

524
00:25:04.068 --> 00:25:05.379
- What?

525
00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:06.448
Hell no, no way.

526
00:25:09.724 --> 00:25:12.206
- Let's see if he tries to turn.

527
00:25:16.793 --> 00:25:17.724
Yeah, it's definitely him.

528
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.241
He's following us.

529
00:25:19.241 --> 00:25:20.862
- Oh, you definitely need
to drive faster then.

530
00:25:20.862 --> 00:25:21.896
What the fuck?

531
00:25:38.517 --> 00:25:40.241
- Shit.

532
00:25:40.241 --> 00:25:41.758
My van!

533
00:25:41.758 --> 00:25:43.689
- Come on, we gotta get away
from this fucking asshole.

534
00:25:43.689 --> 00:25:44.862
- That's what I'm trying to do.

535
00:25:44.862 --> 00:25:46.517
Okay, hang on Emily.

536
00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:50.241
Are we good, are we good?

537
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:51.896
- No, he coming back.

538
00:26:00.586 --> 00:26:02.620
Fuck.

539
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.034
That's the Mechanic Maniac.

540
00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:04.862
- What?

541
00:26:28.448 --> 00:26:29.344
- I'm about to jump out.

542
00:26:29.344 --> 00:26:30.206
- What?

543
00:26:30.206 --> 00:26:31.034
- I'm about to jump out.

544
00:26:31.034 --> 00:26:31.862
What the fuck?

545
00:26:35.793 --> 00:26:36.965
- You gonna have to let me out,

546
00:26:36.965 --> 00:26:38.068
you gonna have to let me out.

547
00:26:38.068 --> 00:26:39.310
Just pull over and let me out.

548
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.034
Just pull over and
let me the fuck out.

549
00:26:40.034 --> 00:26:40.896
Please.

550
00:26:42.724 --> 00:26:44.310
- You have
to calm down, okay.

551
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.137
- Oh, I'm
having a panic attack.

552
00:26:52.103 --> 00:26:53.896
- Come on man, you
have to drive faster.

553
00:26:53.896 --> 00:26:56.206
- It's a living space,
not a fucking Lamborghini.

554
00:26:56.206 --> 00:26:57.793
Okay, hold on to something.

555
00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.103
He can't be serious right now.

556
00:27:13.862 --> 00:27:16.793
- We gotta get the
fuck outta here.

557
00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:23.137
I think, I think we lost him.

558
00:27:23.137 --> 00:27:24.448
I think we may.

559
00:27:24.448 --> 00:27:25.482
We lost him.

560
00:27:25.482 --> 00:27:26.689
- Are we good?
- We lost him.

561
00:27:26.689 --> 00:27:27.517
- Okay.

562
00:27:27.517 --> 00:27:29.482
- Oh shit.

563
00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:31.172
- Okay.
- Oh, that was insane.

564
00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.827
- Dude, we need to call 911.

565
00:27:33.827 --> 00:27:36.482
Someone just tried to kill
us with a fucking truck.

566
00:27:36.482 --> 00:27:38.068
- Hardly, that was
just some idiot driver.

567
00:27:38.068 --> 00:27:39.965
We probably cut him off at
some point and pissed him off.

568
00:27:39.965 --> 00:27:41.931
- Take your phone out
right now and dial 911.

569
00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:43.379
I'll stop at the next exit

570
00:27:43.379 --> 00:27:45.517
and we can get somebody
after this crazy idiot.

571
00:27:45.517 --> 00:27:46.448
- I can't do that.

572
00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:48.344
- Why the fuck not?

573
00:27:51.034 --> 00:27:52.482
- I don't have a phone.

574
00:27:52.482 --> 00:27:54.034
- Everyone carries a cell phone.

575
00:27:54.034 --> 00:27:55.793
- Apparently they don't.

576
00:27:55.793 --> 00:27:57.862
- Please pray tell
explain to me why on earth

577
00:27:57.862 --> 00:27:59.344
you don't have a cell phone.

578
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.172
- Well, have you heard
anything about the 5G thing?

579
00:28:02.172 --> 00:28:03.724
- For fuck sake.

580
00:28:03.724 --> 00:28:05.586
- Yes, I'd heard
and did research--

581
00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:07.379
- You seriously don't have a
cell phone, Micah, so don't--

582
00:28:07.379 --> 00:28:09.172
- No, I don't have
no cell phone!

583
00:28:09.172 --> 00:28:10.275
- You seriously
don't have a phone?

584
00:28:10.275 --> 00:28:11.793
- No I don't.

585
00:28:11.793 --> 00:28:14.103
- Well, I had a phone until you
took it swimming last night.

586
00:28:14.103 --> 00:28:15.724
Now we're fucking
totally screwed.

587
00:28:15.724 --> 00:28:17.517
- No, we just need
to keep driving.

588
00:28:17.517 --> 00:28:18.724
There's no way that man

589
00:28:18.724 --> 00:28:20.206
is gonna get out of
that ditch anytime soon.

590
00:28:27.517 --> 00:28:28.586
- What happened back there?

591
00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:30.000
You totally pussed out.

592
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.758
- What the fuck was
I supposed to do?

593
00:28:31.758 --> 00:28:33.275
That man was attacking
us with a goddamn car!

594
00:28:33.275 --> 00:28:34.103
- Do something.

595
00:28:34.103 --> 00:28:34.931
Anything.

596
00:28:34.931 --> 00:28:35.758
God.

597
00:28:35.758 --> 00:28:36.586
- Yeah, okay.

598
00:28:36.586 --> 00:28:38.551
Un-fucking-believable.

599
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:40.103
- Maybe you're right.

600
00:28:40.103 --> 00:28:41.758
Maybe I did something
that pissed him off.

601
00:28:41.758 --> 00:28:42.758
- See?

602
00:28:42.758 --> 00:28:43.758
Maybe so.

603
00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:50.413
What if it was some
Mechanic Maniac?

604
00:28:50.413 --> 00:28:51.862
- Not a chance.

605
00:28:51.862 --> 00:28:53.275
He doesn't kill people
while he's driving.

606
00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:54.896
He's not the fast
and furious type.

607
00:28:54.896 --> 00:28:57.620
- Yeah, well you
said it yourself.

608
00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.103
There's a first
time for everything.

609
00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:01.724
- Ah shit.

610
00:29:01.724 --> 00:29:03.241
We gotta stop for gas.

611
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.620
- What?

612
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.103
No.

613
00:29:06.103 --> 00:29:07.344
- Micah, I told you before

614
00:29:07.344 --> 00:29:09.241
that there's only one
gas station between here

615
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:11.275
and the next 70 miles or so.

616
00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:12.517
We're low.

617
00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:14.517
Besides, you can run
in and call the cops.

618
00:29:14.517 --> 00:29:16.724
I'm sure it's no 5G in there.

619
00:29:39.689 --> 00:29:42.586
- Dawn, this shit looks
fucking abandoned.

620
00:29:46.655 --> 00:29:47.965
- Yeah, you're right.

621
00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:49.896
It's like the perfect
place to get murdered.

622
00:29:51.793 --> 00:29:53.655
So run inside and call the cops.

623
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.241
- All right.
- Quick like a bunny.

624
00:29:56.241 --> 00:29:57.586
- Okay, damn.

625
00:30:24.482 --> 00:30:25.310
- Shit.

626
00:30:31.551 --> 00:30:32.310
Micah.

627
00:30:33.517 --> 00:30:36.827
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

628
00:30:36.827 --> 00:30:37.620
Micah?

629
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:41.172
- Nuts?

630
00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:43.551
- Micah, what are you doing?

631
00:30:43.551 --> 00:30:44.517
- I was getting snacks,

632
00:30:44.517 --> 00:30:46.068
but I don't see anybody here.

633
00:30:46.068 --> 00:30:47.103
- Somebody's here all right,

634
00:30:47.103 --> 00:30:48.482
and they're driving the Bronco.

635
00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:50.793
- You gotta be kidding me.

636
00:30:50.793 --> 00:30:51.758
- And what happened
to calling the cops?

637
00:30:51.758 --> 00:30:52.586
- I didn't see a phone.

638
00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:53.862
Do you see this place?

639
00:30:53.862 --> 00:30:55.103
I don't even think they
have running water.

640
00:31:29.241 --> 00:31:30.965
What are we gonna do?

641
00:31:30.965 --> 00:31:32.724
- We gotta stay out of sight.

642
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:50.172
Shit.

643
00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:52.655
I think he's gonna
get that old lady.

644
00:31:52.655 --> 00:31:55.482
- Well, maybe that'll distract
him so we can get away.

645
00:31:55.482 --> 00:31:56.896
- Dude, are you serious?

646
00:31:56.896 --> 00:31:58.482
- What else do you have in mind?

647
00:32:02.551 --> 00:32:05.137
- We need a distraction.

648
00:32:05.137 --> 00:32:06.448
- A distraction?
- Let's just go.

649
00:32:06.448 --> 00:32:08.137
- What are you?

650
00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:09.965
Okay.

651
00:32:21.137 --> 00:32:22.931
Hurry up, go, go, go.

652
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.482
I told you we should
have never came

653
00:32:25.482 --> 00:32:26.620
to this damn gas station.

654
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.448
Keep low.

655
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:30.586
Come on.

656
00:32:30.586 --> 00:32:32.413
- Shit.
- Oh my god.

657
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:35.758
- Wait, watch my back.

658
00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:56.241
- I didn't see him.

659
00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:58.068
- He definitely won't miss this.

660
00:32:58.068 --> 00:32:59.344
You got a lighter?

661
00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.620
- No.

662
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.517
- What?
- I don't smoke .

663
00:33:01.517 --> 00:33:02.655
- Get up.

664
00:33:02.655 --> 00:33:03.758
- Where you going?

665
00:33:20.103 --> 00:33:22.275
Dawn, where the fuck are you?

666
00:33:38.034 --> 00:33:39.379
- Hey, get ready to run.

667
00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:41.034
- What are you doing?

668
00:33:41.034 --> 00:33:41.862
No!

669
00:33:45.517 --> 00:33:46.517
- What the hell?

670
00:33:49.517 --> 00:33:52.689
- Don't you know that gas
doesn't burn like that?

671
00:33:52.689 --> 00:33:54.206
Only the fumes are flammable.

672
00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:55.689
- Seriously?

673
00:33:55.689 --> 00:33:57.103
- It's basic science.

674
00:33:57.103 --> 00:33:58.000
- Shit.

675
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.068
Fuck science.

676
00:34:00.137 --> 00:34:02.896
Hey, come on.

677
00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:03.896
- Fuck.

678
00:35:54.172 --> 00:35:55.448
- I gotta do somethin'.

679
00:35:55.448 --> 00:35:57.137
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Micah!

680
00:35:57.137 --> 00:35:57.896
Shit.

681
00:35:59.275 --> 00:36:01.482
- Come on,
fly this motherfucker.

682
00:36:01.482 --> 00:36:02.551
Start the damn car.

683
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:03.379
Come on.

684
00:36:18.172 --> 00:36:19.655
- Banana in the tailpipe?

685
00:36:19.655 --> 00:36:20.896
That's your master plan?

686
00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:22.413
- Hey, it worked in
"Beverly Hills Cop".

687
00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:23.689
- I must have missed that one.

688
00:36:23.689 --> 00:36:25.344
- It's a fucking classic.

689
00:36:25.344 --> 00:36:27.241
- It better work, otherwise
he's gonna be behind us

690
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:28.379
in like two seconds.

691
00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:29.862
- Oh, I promise you

692
00:36:29.862 --> 00:36:31.379
I'll work better than that
trail of gas explosion would.

693
00:36:31.379 --> 00:36:33.206
- Hey, I'm pretty sure
that's from a movie too.

694
00:36:33.206 --> 00:36:34.827
- Yeah, well if you
watch "MythBusters"--

695
00:36:35.724 --> 00:36:36.655
Oh shit.

696
00:36:36.655 --> 00:36:37.793
- And now he's shooting at us.

697
00:36:37.793 --> 00:36:39.310
- Who the fuck is this asshole?

698
00:36:43.551 --> 00:36:44.827
- Where is he?

699
00:36:44.827 --> 00:36:45.689
- I don't know, he's
fucking behind us.

700
00:36:53.137 --> 00:36:55.034
- Oh fuck!
- Oh shit!

701
00:36:55.034 --> 00:36:55.862
- Fuck!
- Shit!

702
00:36:55.862 --> 00:36:56.689
- What the fuck!

703
00:36:58.655 --> 00:36:59.724
- Micah, take the wheel.

704
00:36:59.724 --> 00:37:00.793
- Huh?

705
00:37:00.793 --> 00:37:01.965
- Just grab the fucking wheel.

706
00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:09.586
- Oh, this isn't very safe.

707
00:37:09.586 --> 00:37:10.758
- It's safer than--
- What is that?

708
00:37:10.758 --> 00:37:11.965
Please don't that,
don't do that.

709
00:37:11.965 --> 00:37:12.793
- Close your eyes,
close your eyes.

710
00:37:12.793 --> 00:37:13.448
- Oh my god.

711
00:37:15.965 --> 00:37:17.137
- Nobody shoots
at my van, bitch.

712
00:37:33.206 --> 00:37:35.413
You can open your eyes now.

713
00:37:37.103 --> 00:37:38.172
Are you serious?

714
00:37:43.758 --> 00:37:46.655
- Didn't you just shoot
him with a flare gun?

715
00:37:46.655 --> 00:37:48.482
- Any port in a
storm, my friend.

716
00:37:48.482 --> 00:37:50.206
- Oh yeah, your ass is crazy.

717
00:37:50.206 --> 00:37:51.034
- Hey!
- All of you

718
00:37:51.034 --> 00:37:52.275
are fucking insane.

719
00:37:52.275 --> 00:37:53.586
- I almost had to pull
out the paper towels

720
00:37:53.586 --> 00:37:55.793
for you to piss in your pants.

721
00:37:55.793 --> 00:37:57.586
- I don't think we're
quite there yet, thanks.

722
00:37:57.586 --> 00:37:58.793
- Close enough.

723
00:38:02.034 --> 00:38:04.137
- Oh, I don't think it's over!

724
00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:14.172
What do we do, what do we do?

725
00:38:14.172 --> 00:38:15.344
- I don't know.

726
00:38:19.241 --> 00:38:20.206
- Wait.

727
00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:21.103
He's slowing down.

728
00:38:23.413 --> 00:38:24.862
Holy shit.

729
00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.275
The banana.

730
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.931
Once again, cinema saves us

731
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:32.206
from the most
disastrous situation.

732
00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.344
- Incredible.

733
00:38:35.517 --> 00:38:37.137
How the hell?

734
00:38:37.137 --> 00:38:38.689
- How the hell, I told
you she was gonna work.

735
00:38:38.689 --> 00:38:39.862
Drive.

736
00:38:39.862 --> 00:38:40.689
- I'm driving.

737
00:38:41.896 --> 00:38:43.482
- Your ass better watch

to be reading that
while driving.

756
00:39:23.275 --> 00:39:25.620
- Well of all the incidents
in our action packed day,

757
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.241
I'd say this one is pretty tame.

758
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.206
- We fucking lost, aren't we?

759
00:39:31.206 --> 00:39:32.896
- Not at all.

760
00:39:32.896 --> 00:39:34.344
I had an idea where we
can get even further away

761
00:39:34.344 --> 00:39:36.413
from that mechanic.

762
00:39:37.413 --> 00:39:38.241
There it is.

763
00:39:39.448 --> 00:39:40.724
It's a back road.

764
00:39:40.724 --> 00:39:42.068
It'll still get us
to Portland in time,

765
00:39:42.068 --> 00:39:44.103
but it'll keep us
off the highways.

766
00:39:44.103 --> 00:39:45.862
Hopefully leaving
that asshole behind.

767
00:39:53.448 --> 00:39:55.551
What the hell do you
think he's after?

768
00:39:55.551 --> 00:39:56.896
- Well, if it is the mechanic,

769
00:39:56.896 --> 00:39:59.586
you definitely fit his
victim requirement.

770
00:39:59.586 --> 00:40:00.931
- Not at all.

771
00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:03.586
All of his prey are
consistently found solo,

772
00:40:03.586 --> 00:40:05.137
kidnapped in a vehicle,

773
00:40:05.137 --> 00:40:07.965
and taken to a specific place
for torture and mutilation.

774
00:40:07.965 --> 00:40:09.724
Wouldn't even make sense
for him to go after somebody

775
00:40:09.724 --> 00:40:12.275
on an open road,
especially not with a gun.

776
00:40:12.275 --> 00:40:14.931
- Well, why the fuck is
he following us, Dawn?

777
00:40:14.931 --> 00:40:15.827
Who are you?

778
00:40:15.827 --> 00:40:17.000
- Who am I?

779
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.103
I'm nobody.

780
00:40:18.103 --> 00:40:19.724
Who the fuck are you?

781
00:40:19.724 --> 00:40:20.931
Maybe you are the
one he's after.

782
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:22.344
- I don't know about that.

783
00:40:22.344 --> 00:40:24.586
And why the fuck are we
not taking the highway?

784
00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:25.862
- We wanna keep away
from the highway

785
00:40:25.862 --> 00:40:27.379
to stay away from that asshole.

786
00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:28.896
- Seems a little sketchy to me.

787
00:40:28.896 --> 00:40:31.551
- Well, if you want, I can
drop you off right here.

788
00:40:31.551 --> 00:40:32.862
You'd be a sitting dick.

789
00:40:32.862 --> 00:40:33.862
- You mean duck.

790
00:40:33.862 --> 00:40:34.931
- No I didn't.
- Whatever.

791
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.827
And if it is the mechanic,
then all bets off.

792
00:40:40.103 --> 00:40:42.000
- - This doesn't fit his M.O.

793
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.931
- Maybe it's a copycat,

794
00:40:42.931 --> 00:40:44.413
some killer on the prow

795
00:40:44.413 --> 00:40:45.689
where he can only kill
people with his fucking car.

796
00:40:45.689 --> 00:40:47.896
- Mechanic's too smart for that.

797
00:40:47.896 --> 00:40:50.206
There's gotta be
something else he's after.

798
00:40:50.206 --> 00:40:52.551
- Maybe you the fucking
mechanic for all I know.

799
00:40:53.413 --> 00:40:54.206
- Good one.

800
00:41:00.413 --> 00:41:01.793
- Why is he after you Dawn?

801
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.103
Seriously, tell me.

802
00:41:05.103 --> 00:41:06.620
- Fuck you, dude.

803
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.793
I have no idea who
this douche bag is.

804
00:41:08.793 --> 00:41:11.137
And frankly, I don't
appreciate the accusations.

805
00:41:18.137 --> 00:41:19.275
- Speaking of Portland,

806
00:41:21.586 --> 00:41:24.137
I did get this for you when
we were at the gas station.

807
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.551
- That was sweet.

808
00:41:36.344 --> 00:41:38.655
- So you said your
father was a hunter.

809
00:41:38.655 --> 00:41:40.137
What kind of stuff did he hunt?

810
00:41:41.344 --> 00:41:43.379
- White tailed deer mostly,

811
00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:45.103
occasional fox,

812
00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:45.896
black bear.

813
00:41:47.965 --> 00:41:49.551
- Hunting a bear would be crazy.

814
00:41:50.448 --> 00:41:51.241
- Yeah.

815
00:41:53.896 --> 00:41:55.344
- Come on, what the fuck now?

816
00:41:55.344 --> 00:41:56.172
- I don't know.

817
00:41:56.172 --> 00:41:57.310
I think it's the engine.

818
00:41:58.517 --> 00:42:00.172
- From our run in with
the mechanic, you think?

819
00:42:00.172 --> 00:42:01.241
- Maybe.

820
00:42:01.241 --> 00:42:02.034
- I'm gonna have
to check it out.

821
00:42:02.034 --> 00:42:04.206
- Oh man, what the fuck.

822
00:42:06.862 --> 00:42:09.137
- We need to
pull off over here.

823
00:42:20.689 --> 00:42:23.034
- One thing after another,

824
00:42:23.034 --> 00:42:23.862
literally.

825
00:42:38.068 --> 00:42:40.448
Come on, Dawn, the fuck.

826
00:42:40.448 --> 00:42:41.724
How bad is it?

827
00:42:41.724 --> 00:42:43.068
- Looks pretty bad.

828
00:42:43.068 --> 00:42:45.000
Think I blew a hose.

829
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
- I don't know
anything about cars.

830
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.241
- Well, it's a van,

831
00:42:48.241 --> 00:42:49.896
so it's a difference.

832
00:42:49.896 --> 00:42:50.724
- Vans either.

833
00:42:52.206 --> 00:42:54.517
- Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to fix this.

834
00:42:56.482 --> 00:42:57.344
- What do you mean?

835
00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.620
We need to get back on the road?

836
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.758
- Well, we can't
if the van won't run.

837
00:43:04.931 --> 00:43:06.827
- How did I even end
up in this situation?

838
00:43:06.827 --> 00:43:08.344
I gotta just stay my
ass at that damn bar.

839
00:43:08.344 --> 00:43:10.448
- Calm down.

840
00:43:10.448 --> 00:43:14.068
Look, the highway is only
a couple of miles that way.

841
00:43:14.068 --> 00:43:16.068
If we hike it, we
can find a car,

842
00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:17.724
flag it down and call AAA.

843
00:43:17.724 --> 00:43:19.137
It's not a big deal.

844
00:43:19.137 --> 00:43:20.931
- I feel like every element
of this fucking trip

845
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:21.931
has been a big deal.

846
00:43:21.931 --> 00:43:23.793
- Jesus, get a hold of yourself.

847
00:43:23.793 --> 00:43:25.034
It'll be darken an hour.

848
00:43:25.034 --> 00:43:26.448
So we need to get
a move on, okay.

849
00:43:28.137 --> 00:43:29.620
- I don't think we
should leave the van.

850
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.103
- Well, we don't have a choice.

851
00:43:32.448 --> 00:43:33.448
- Fuck!

852
00:43:36.724 --> 00:43:37.862
- Wait!
- What?

853
00:43:39.241 --> 00:43:40.068
- Look.

854
00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:44.137
- Oh

855
00:43:44.137 --> 00:43:45.310
shit!

856
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.275
- I'd recognize
those traps anywhere.

857
00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:48.931
That's a bear trap.

858
00:43:48.931 --> 00:43:50.413
These are hunting woods.

859
00:43:50.413 --> 00:43:51.655
- Yeah, well I'm definitely

860
00:43:51.655 --> 00:43:53.137
not walking through
those woods now.

861
00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:54.448
The fuck.

862
00:43:54.448 --> 00:43:55.379
- Well, Micah, we
don't have a choice.

863
00:43:55.379 --> 00:43:56.482
We have to go.

864
00:43:56.482 --> 00:43:58.793
- Can this day
possibly get any worse.

865
00:44:00.068 --> 00:44:01.000
- You hear that?

866
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.172
- Oh.

867
00:44:07.379 --> 00:44:08.413
Come on, we gotta get
away from that psycho!

868
00:44:08.413 --> 00:44:09.241
Come on.

869
00:44:09.241 --> 00:44:10.103
Get up.

870
00:44:10.103 --> 00:44:10.931
Start running.

871
00:44:10.931 --> 00:44:11.758
Run.

872
00:44:11.758 --> 00:44:12.586
- I'm coming.

873
00:44:14.034 --> 00:44:15.034
Shit.

874
00:44:16.862 --> 00:44:19.103
- Run, run, run,
please run, run, run.

875
00:44:19.103 --> 00:44:20.379
Oh my god run.

876
00:44:20.379 --> 00:44:21.862
This is bullshit.

877
00:44:34.517 --> 00:44:35.344
What's the plan?

878
00:44:38.137 --> 00:44:39.344
What's the fucking plan?

879
00:44:40.448 --> 00:44:41.310
- Wait.

880
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.137
- Wait for what?

881
00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:42.965
To get fucking creamed?

882
00:44:42.965 --> 00:44:44.275
- Just trust me.

883
00:44:44.275 --> 00:44:45.103
Wait.

884
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.103
Come on, big boy.

885
00:44:48.172 --> 00:44:48.965
Come and get us.

886
00:44:48.965 --> 00:44:50.517
- I figured it out.

887
00:44:50.517 --> 00:44:51.689
You're psychotic.

888
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:52.620
Yes.

889
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.862
- Not yet.

890
00:44:53.862 --> 00:44:54.827
- Dawn, you better
leave me the fuck--

891
00:44:54.827 --> 00:44:55.482
- Not yet.
- Oh my god.

892
00:45:00.206 --> 00:45:01.068
Oh!

893
00:45:03.689 --> 00:45:04.517
- Now!

894
00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:13.896
- Lord have mercy.

895
00:45:13.896 --> 00:45:16.448
- See, told
you to follow me.

896
00:45:16.448 --> 00:45:18.758
- Okay, Dawn.

897
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:19.896
Let's go.

898
00:45:19.896 --> 00:45:21.517
- Not yet.

899
00:45:21.517 --> 00:45:24.172
Need to see who this
psychopath is first.

900
00:45:24.172 --> 00:45:25.103
- Are you
nuts, who cares?

901
00:45:25.103 --> 00:45:26.103
Let's get back to the van.

902
00:45:26.103 --> 00:45:27.241
- Not yet.

903
00:45:33.413 --> 00:45:34.413
Who is this?

904
00:45:39.758 --> 00:45:41.241
I think he's dead.

905
00:45:52.103 --> 00:45:53.344
- Get back here!

906
00:46:00.827 --> 00:46:02.000
- Shit.

907
00:46:02.931 --> 00:46:04.448
- Get back here.

908
00:46:04.448 --> 00:46:05.413
Oh, you think it's a game, huh.

909
00:46:05.413 --> 00:46:06.413
Yeah.

910
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.551
I can see you.

911
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:19.482
Get out here!

912
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:23.241
I see you.

913
00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:25.000
Get out here now!

914
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.172
- What do you want with us?

915
00:46:26.172 --> 00:46:28.724
- I don't want you sweetheart.

916
00:46:28.724 --> 00:46:29.551
You fine.

917
00:46:30.827 --> 00:46:31.655
It's him.

918
00:46:32.965 --> 00:46:34.000
- What did he do?

919
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.689
- Oh.

920
00:46:36.689 --> 00:46:38.827
Oh, you ain't tell
your little girlfriend?

921
00:46:38.827 --> 00:46:39.827
Huh?

922
00:46:39.827 --> 00:46:41.758
You ain't tell her what you did?

923
00:46:41.758 --> 00:46:43.655
You sick son of bitch.

924
00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:46.655
Words can't describe
what he did.

925
00:46:46.655 --> 00:46:48.068
- Sir, I think you
got the wrong guy.

926
00:46:48.068 --> 00:46:50.344
I ain't never seen
your old ass before.

927
00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:52.482
- Oh, you right.

928
00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:54.137
You know what?

929
00:46:55.172 --> 00:46:56.413
Whew.

930
00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.551
I am getting old,

931
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.413
but see you,

932
00:47:00.413 --> 00:47:01.931
you ain't gonna get that chance

933
00:47:01.931 --> 00:47:04.862
'cause I'm gonna kill your
black ass today, motherfucker.

934
00:47:13.241 --> 00:47:14.413
Get back over here!

935
00:47:17.344 --> 00:47:19.344
Oh, okay.

936
00:47:19.344 --> 00:47:20.896
I see what it is.

937
00:47:29.655 --> 00:47:31.068
- Hunter's woods.

938
00:47:31.068 --> 00:47:33.206
Hide behind there, keep
your ass quiet, okay.

939
00:47:33.206 --> 00:47:34.482
Go, go, go.

940
00:47:36.172 --> 00:47:37.310
Look man,

941
00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:38.586
please,

942
00:47:38.586 --> 00:47:40.586
please don't shoot, okay.

943
00:47:40.586 --> 00:47:41.620
I don't want any trouble.

944
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:42.965
- And I told you

945
00:47:42.965 --> 00:47:44.965
I'm not here for you.

946
00:47:44.965 --> 00:47:45.827
I want him.

947
00:47:45.827 --> 00:47:47.551
- Okay, just be cool.

948
00:47:47.551 --> 00:47:49.655
Nobody has to get shot.

949
00:47:49.655 --> 00:47:50.448
Okay.

950
00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:54.413
- And I don't wanna shoot
you, but I will if I have to.

951
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:56.517
So I'm not gonna ask you again.

952
00:47:56.517 --> 00:47:58.000
Where is he?

953
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.655
- Look,

954
00:47:59.655 --> 00:48:02.103
I swear I have no
clue where he is.

955
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.724
I don't know.

956
00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.448
Okay.

957
00:48:09.137 --> 00:48:10.620
- So he just left you, huh?

958
00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.448
- Yeah.

959
00:48:12.724 --> 00:48:14.068
- Some cold shit.

960
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.758
How you just gonna leave
your girl like that?

961
00:48:22.482 --> 00:48:23.793
Told you he wasn't shit.

962
00:48:24.965 --> 00:48:25.965
End of the line.

963
00:48:25.965 --> 00:48:26.931
Oh shit!

964
00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:27.793
Oh!

965
00:48:27.793 --> 00:48:28.931
- Oh shit.

966
00:48:30.517 --> 00:48:31.758
- Fuck!

967
00:48:31.758 --> 00:48:32.586
- Oh,

968
00:48:33.965 --> 00:48:34.896
bravo.

969
00:48:36.724 --> 00:48:38.206
You really fucking caught him.

970
00:48:40.275 --> 00:48:41.482
- You gotta get me down.

971
00:48:41.482 --> 00:48:42.896
I can't help you if you if,

972
00:48:42.896 --> 00:48:44.275
if don't let me the fuck down.

973
00:48:44.275 --> 00:48:45.551
- Why are you following us?

974
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:46.965
- I told you.

975
00:48:46.965 --> 00:48:48.103
I'm not following you.

976
00:48:48.103 --> 00:48:49.206
I want him.

977
00:48:49.206 --> 00:48:50.620
- Shut your crazy ass up.

978
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.310
Dawn, let's go.

979
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:53.620
- But why?

980
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.379
Are you the Mechanic Maniac?

981
00:48:55.379 --> 00:48:56.586
- No.

982
00:48:56.586 --> 00:48:57.517
No.

983
00:48:57.517 --> 00:48:58.517
He's the maniac.

984
00:48:58.517 --> 00:48:59.758
- What?

985
00:48:59.758 --> 00:49:00.758
- No.

986
00:49:00.758 --> 00:49:01.655
This has motherfucker is nuts.

987
00:49:01.655 --> 00:49:03.275
We need to go.

988
00:49:03.275 --> 00:49:04.379
- Dawn.

989
00:49:04.379 --> 00:49:06.655
Dawn, is your name.

990
00:49:06.655 --> 00:49:08.689
Dawn, you gotta listen to me.

991
00:49:08.689 --> 00:49:10.586
He killed my only son.

992
00:49:10.586 --> 00:49:12.482
He killed my boy Jamie.

993
00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:13.310
- Fuck you, old man.

994
00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:14.517
I ain't kill nobody.

995
00:49:14.517 --> 00:49:15.827
His ass is lying, Dawn.

996
00:49:15.827 --> 00:49:16.655
Let's go.

997
00:49:16.655 --> 00:49:17.896
What the fuck?

998
00:49:17.896 --> 00:49:20.275
- You son of a bitch,
I saw you drag him off.

999
00:49:20.275 --> 00:49:21.827
I saw you that night.

1000
00:49:21.827 --> 00:49:24.275
And I was following
your ass ever since.

1001
00:49:24.275 --> 00:49:25.689
Hunting you.

1002
00:49:25.689 --> 00:49:26.517
- Micah,

1003
00:49:27.448 --> 00:49:29.689
Micah, what is he talking about?

1004
00:49:29.689 --> 00:49:31.034
- You know me, it's bullshit.

1005
00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:31.862
I don't know.

1006
00:49:31.862 --> 00:49:33.689
What the fuck?

1007
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:39.275
- Dawn, you don't know him.

1008
00:49:39.275 --> 00:49:40.103
Dawn.

1009
00:49:41.655 --> 00:49:42.758
What are you doing?

1010
00:49:42.758 --> 00:49:44.965
What are you doing?

1011
00:49:44.965 --> 00:49:45.965
No.

1012
00:49:45.965 --> 00:49:47.206
Dawn, you gotta let me down.

1013
00:49:47.206 --> 00:49:48.551
You gotta shot him

1014
00:49:48.551 --> 00:49:50.965
or he's gonna kill you next.

1015
00:49:50.965 --> 00:49:52.172
He'll kill you next.

1016
00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:55.000
- Dawn, shoot him, he's
clearly the maniac.

1017
00:49:56.206 --> 00:49:59.379
- Dawn, please baby
girl, listen to me.

1018
00:49:59.379 --> 00:50:01.413
My name is Anthony.

1019
00:50:01.413 --> 00:50:02.241
I'm a father

1020
00:50:03.379 --> 00:50:04.517
who lost his son

1021
00:50:05.793 --> 00:50:08.275
at the hands of this murderer.

1022
00:50:08.275 --> 00:50:09.827
He killed my boy, Jamie.

1023
00:50:10.965 --> 00:50:13.551
Shoot him before he kills you.

1024
00:50:13.551 --> 00:50:14.862
- Fuck what he
talking about, Dawn.

1025
00:50:14.862 --> 00:50:16.379
Pay attention to me.

1026
00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:17.482
He's fucking lying.

1027
00:50:17.482 --> 00:50:18.344
Kill him.

1028
00:50:18.344 --> 00:50:19.275
He hurt Emily.

1029
00:50:19.275 --> 00:50:20.241
What the fuck, shoot him.

1030
00:50:20.241 --> 00:50:21.103
- Emily?

1031
00:50:21.103 --> 00:50:22.827
Who the fuck is Emily?

1032
00:50:24.034 --> 00:50:26.344
What the fuck are you doing?

1033
00:50:28.344 --> 00:50:30.413
- He got a gun!

1034
00:50:43.862 --> 00:50:45.275
- What a fucking day.

1035
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.275
Oh Jesus.

1036
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.344
You did the right thing, Dawn.

1037
00:51:01.379 --> 00:51:02.482
You did the right thing.

1038
00:51:04.206 --> 00:51:05.448
That motherfucker was
just trying to kill us.

1039
00:51:05.448 --> 00:51:06.586
You just saved my life.

1040
00:51:08.551 --> 00:51:09.379
All right?

1041
00:51:13.068 --> 00:51:14.344
Let's get back to the van.

1042
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.034
- No.

1043
00:51:23.586 --> 00:51:25.413
- What did you just say?

1044
00:51:25.413 --> 00:51:26.931
- I said, no.

1045
00:51:26.931 --> 00:51:29.137
We need to take that way
and go back to the highway.

1046
00:51:31.448 --> 00:51:33.586
- I'm pretty sure we agreed
to go back to the van.

1047
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:36.379
- The van is toast.

1048
00:51:36.379 --> 00:51:38.034
We have no choice but
to go to the highway

1049
00:51:38.034 --> 00:51:39.344
and flag someone down.

1050
00:51:39.344 --> 00:51:40.137
- Nope.

1051
00:51:41.482 --> 00:51:42.413
We can't do that.

1052
00:51:44.827 --> 00:51:45.862
- What is wrong with you?

1053
00:51:45.862 --> 00:51:47.931
We only have one option.

1054
00:51:59.206 --> 00:52:00.482
- You're right.

1055
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.655
And it's following my
directions or else.

1056
00:52:06.827 --> 00:52:07.827
- Or else what?

1057
00:52:07.827 --> 00:52:08.655
- Or else

1058
00:52:09.655 --> 00:52:10.931
I'm gonna butcher you exactly

1059
00:52:10.931 --> 00:52:12.310
like how did his fat ass son.

1060
00:52:15.068 --> 00:52:15.896
- What?

1061
00:52:26.793 --> 00:52:28.931
- You're not much of
a criminalist are you?

1062
00:52:31.275 --> 00:52:33.034
Riding around

1063
00:52:33.034 --> 00:52:35.931
with a serial killer for
hours with no fucking clue.

1064
00:52:37.137 --> 00:52:39.241
You might wanna find
another profession.

1065
00:52:41.896 --> 00:52:43.310
- No.

1066
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.137
- Yeah.

1067
00:52:47.758 --> 00:52:48.551
Shit.

1068
00:52:55.827 --> 00:52:56.655
Poor Anthony.

1069
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.379
You just killed an
innocent man in cold blood.

1070
00:53:10.482 --> 00:53:13.034
At least that's what
I'll tell the police.

1071
00:53:15.172 --> 00:53:18.344
I mean your prints are all
over the murder weapon.

1072
00:53:18.344 --> 00:53:20.000
It'll be,

1073
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.551
you know,

1074
00:53:21.551 --> 00:53:22.689
an open shut case.

1075
00:53:24.586 --> 00:53:25.724
- You're a monster.
- No,

1076
00:53:25.724 --> 00:53:27.551
no, not quite,

1077
00:53:27.551 --> 00:53:28.655
not quite.

1078
00:53:28.655 --> 00:53:29.793
I think

1079
00:53:29.793 --> 00:53:32.344
the word that you used was

1080
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:37.034
genius.

1081
00:53:38.517 --> 00:53:40.206
And I appreciate that,

1082
00:53:40.206 --> 00:53:41.034
but

1083
00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:43.896
don't put me on a pedestal.

1084
00:53:43.896 --> 00:53:46.655
I'm not one of those
guys who has infatuation

1085
00:53:46.655 --> 00:53:47.482
killing homeless people

1086
00:53:47.482 --> 00:53:49.241
or it's like

1087
00:53:49.241 --> 00:53:51.862
prostitutes and privileged kids.

1088
00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:52.689
None of that.

1089
00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:54.137
I,

1090
00:53:54.137 --> 00:53:56.551
I just enjoying
killing motherfuckers,

1091
00:53:56.551 --> 00:53:57.517
preferably

1092
00:53:57.517 --> 00:53:59.310
slicing and dicing they ass up.

1093
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:00.206
You like,

1094
00:54:03.068 --> 00:54:04.827
I don't know, like maybe
the sound just fuck with me.

1095
00:54:04.827 --> 00:54:06.724
I don't know, it
does something to me.

1096
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.241
- You're a sick fuck.

1097
00:54:09.241 --> 00:54:10.034
- So?

1098
00:54:11.034 --> 00:54:12.620
You

1099
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620
listen to me

1100
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:18.724
or shit is gonna get a
lot messier than this.

1101
00:54:18.724 --> 00:54:20.551
- What the fuck are
you gonna do, Micah?

1102
00:54:20.551 --> 00:54:21.862
You gonna shoot me?

1103
00:54:21.862 --> 00:54:24.551
- Dawn.

1104
00:54:24.551 --> 00:54:26.034
Don't insult me.

1105
00:54:26.034 --> 00:54:27.965
You know, I have never
killed anyone with a gun.

1106
00:54:30.379 --> 00:54:31.310
Ever, I mean.

1107
00:54:35.137 --> 00:54:36.275
What's the fun in that?

1108
00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:39.241
That's no fun.

1109
00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:44.241
So,

1110
00:54:46.931 --> 00:54:48.931
let's get back to the van.

1111
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:49.931
- I said no.

1112
00:54:52.448 --> 00:54:53.344
- March, bitch.

1113
00:54:57.103 --> 00:54:58.068
Bye, Anthony.

1114
00:55:04.517 --> 00:55:05.586
- I get it, you know.

1115
00:55:06.827 --> 00:55:07.586
I see why we have to
go back to the van.

1116
00:55:07.586 --> 00:55:08.793
- You don't see shit.

1117
00:55:08.793 --> 00:55:09.689
Shut up and march.

1118
00:55:09.689 --> 00:55:10.793
- I've read your file.

1119
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:14.586
You can't kill me.

1120
00:55:15.793 --> 00:55:17.758
You only kill your
victims in cars.

1121
00:55:19.206 --> 00:55:21.310
That's why you need
to go back to the van.

1122
00:55:22.724 --> 00:55:24.551
- Bitch, who the fuck do
you think you're talking to?

1123
00:55:24.551 --> 00:55:26.344
I can kill your ass
right here on the spot.

1124
00:55:26.344 --> 00:55:27.896
- Hm?

1125
00:55:27.896 --> 00:55:30.862
What is it about cars
that turn you on?

1126
00:55:31.827 --> 00:55:33.827
Is it the smell of the leather?

1127
00:55:33.827 --> 00:55:36.655
Oh no, I bet it's the
rumble of the engine, huh?

1128
00:55:38.103 --> 00:55:40.517
- You don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

1129
00:55:40.517 --> 00:55:41.482
Let's go.

1130
00:55:41.482 --> 00:55:42.965
- It's your trap, isn't it.

1131
00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:45.344
Or at least that's
how you see it.

1132
00:55:45.344 --> 00:55:48.206
I mean, they're trapped
inside of a small little box.

1133
00:55:48.206 --> 00:55:51.310
You catch them and then
you take them apart.

1134
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.965
It's like ripping
wings off of a fly.

1135
00:55:52.965 --> 00:55:54.655
- Just shut the
fuck up and march!

1136
00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:59.793
- Someone trap you
inside of a box

1137
00:55:59.793 --> 00:56:00.758
or a room?

1138
00:56:01.931 --> 00:56:03.655
Did they take you
apart to, Micah?

1139
00:56:03.655 --> 00:56:04.862
- Dawn,

1140
00:56:04.862 --> 00:56:06.862
if you use that
tongue with me again,

1141
00:56:07.724 --> 00:56:08.931
I'm going to cut it out.

1142
00:56:13.241 --> 00:56:15.068
- You're gonna have
to catch me first.

1143
00:56:22.758 --> 00:56:23.586
- Fuck!

1144
00:56:29.931 --> 00:56:31.448
- Hunter's woods.

1145
00:56:31.448 --> 00:56:33.379
Did you forget, genius?

1146
00:56:35.862 --> 00:56:37.620
- Oh God, I'm turn
you in the buckets.

1147
00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:38.655
- Wait, what's that?

1148
00:56:38.655 --> 00:56:39.482
- Oh my god.

1149
00:56:39.482 --> 00:56:40.793
- Wait, huh?

1150
00:56:40.793 --> 00:56:41.931
I can't hear you over
that bitch ass crying.

1151
00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:43.517
Little pussy.

1152
00:56:44.758 --> 00:56:45.586
Can't hear you.

1153
00:56:46.931 --> 00:56:49.172
- I swear God, I'm
gonna fucking kill you.

1154
00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:50.758
- Come and find me!

1155
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.310
- Micah.

1156
00:57:31.413 --> 00:57:32.827
Micah.

1157
00:57:56.448 --> 00:57:57.241
- Oh, I'm gonna kill ya.

1158
00:57:57.241 --> 00:57:58.172
Oh, I'm gonna kill ya.

1159
00:57:58.172 --> 00:57:59.344
Oh fuck.

1160
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.724
Dawn, get your bitch
ass back here man.

1161
00:58:21.241 --> 00:58:22.965
Dawn, get your ass back here.

1162
00:59:08.103 --> 00:59:08.931
- Shit.

1163
00:59:13.689 --> 00:59:14.862
Come on.

1164
00:59:14.862 --> 00:59:17.103
- There's no need for that.

1165
00:59:18.448 --> 00:59:19.275
I'm right here.

1166
00:59:20.379 --> 00:59:22.965
- Wow, you look like shit.

1167
00:59:22.965 --> 00:59:23.793
- Hmm.

1168
00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.379
Thank you.

1169
00:59:25.379 --> 00:59:26.965
But you know, Dawn,

1170
00:59:28.068 --> 00:59:29.793
it's enough of
these fucking games.

1171
00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.793
Get your motherfucking ass

1172
00:59:33.793 --> 00:59:35.448
back to the fucking
van right now!

1173
00:59:37.103 --> 00:59:37.931
- You're right.

1174
00:59:39.586 --> 00:59:41.000
I'm tired of this game too.

1175
00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.275
- That thing is not
gonna kill me, Dawn.

1176
00:59:56.586 --> 00:59:57.620
- I'm counting on it.

1177
01:00:22.724 --> 01:00:24.275
Let's play

1178
01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:25.586
a different game now.

1179
01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:51.655
- You stupid bitch.

1180
01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:52.689
- Here's a little gift

1181
01:00:52.689 --> 01:00:54.241
to help even out
the odds, Micah.

1182
01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:03.448
- Okay, Dawn,

1183
01:01:06.034 --> 01:01:08.000
I'll play your idiotic game.

1184
01:01:15.206 --> 01:01:16.275
Stupid bitch.

1185
01:01:18.344 --> 01:01:19.344
Okay, Dawn.

1186
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:21.758
All right.

1187
01:01:23.862 --> 01:01:25.655
I'll play your
fucking idiotic game.

1188
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.275
- Can you find me?

1189
01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:38.275
I knew it was you, murderer.

1190
01:01:38.275 --> 01:01:41.413
- Come out, come out
wherever you are.

1191
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.448
- I'm right here.

1192
01:01:49.586 --> 01:01:50.344
Micah.

1193
01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:53.758
- Oh, I'm gonna kill this bitch.

1194
01:01:53.758 --> 01:01:56.448
- Micah, where am I?

1195
01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:59.379
- Now where for fuck are you?

1196
01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:00.655
- I'm everywhere.

1197
01:02:00.655 --> 01:02:02.172
I was there when you
napped Jose Keller

1198
01:02:02.172 --> 01:02:04.137
after his 16th birthday party.

1199
01:02:06.103 --> 01:02:07.275
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1200
01:02:08.413 --> 01:02:09.655
- Micah.

1201
01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:14.448
I was there when you drug a
barely conscious Brook Thompson

1202
01:02:14.448 --> 01:02:15.965
through the Hickory Creek woods

1203
01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.344
after her second date
with the dude named Brad.

1204
01:02:21.551 --> 01:02:22.931
- No fucking way.

1205
01:02:28.931 --> 01:02:29.758
Fuck!

1206
01:02:33.103 --> 01:02:35.448
- I'm well
aware of who you are

1207
01:02:35.448 --> 01:02:36.862
and what you've done.

1208
01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:44.413
I was there the night you
butchered Jamie Miller

1209
01:02:44.413 --> 01:02:46.000
with the reciprocating saw.

1210
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.103
Before catching up with
you at the truck stop.

1211
01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:52.689
- Bring your punk ass out here.

1212
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.275
- I carefully built
that fun obstacle course

1213
01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:55.724
in the nearby was woods here.

1214
01:02:55.724 --> 01:02:57.689
- Come on.

1215
01:02:57.689 --> 01:03:00.137
- I wasn't lying about my
father being a trapper.

1216
01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:04.448
He definitely taught me
everything I needed to know.

1217
01:03:05.655 --> 01:03:07.482
I knew you liked to
frequent that bar.

1218
01:03:07.482 --> 01:03:09.137
So it was easy for
me to find you.

1219
01:03:10.275 --> 01:03:11.517
I was well aware

1220
01:03:11.517 --> 01:03:13.034
you didn't keep a phone
so you couldn't tracked.

1221
01:03:13.034 --> 01:03:14.965
We could take a selfie so
we can capture this moment.

1222
01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:16.344
- Fuck.

1223
01:03:16.344 --> 01:03:17.724
- I figured you wouldn't
let me keep mine either.

1224
01:03:17.724 --> 01:03:19.827
So I let you destroy it.

1225
01:03:19.827 --> 01:03:21.310
It was just a backup.

1226
01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:22.137
Don't worry.

1227
01:03:22.137 --> 01:03:23.310
My selfies are safe.

1228
01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.310
- Come on,

1229
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.655
come on.
- Murderer.

1230
01:03:26.655 --> 01:03:27.758
- Come on, bitch.

1231
01:03:27.758 --> 01:03:30.000
- Where am I?

1232
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.241
- Move your ass.

1233
01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:33.724
- Find me.

1234
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.827
- Come on!

1235
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:40.758
- Micah.

1236
01:03:42.379 --> 01:03:43.482
Fuck!

1237
01:03:43.482 --> 01:03:46.758
Fuck!

1238
01:03:46.758 --> 01:03:48.172
- I was
impressed by the gadget

1239
01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:51.068
you built to open the
air bags in Jamie's car.

1240
01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:52.448
So I designed one of my own

1241
01:03:52.448 --> 01:03:54.310
to help stop the
engine in the van.

1242
01:03:55.482 --> 01:03:56.724
- Come on, what the fuck now?

1243
01:03:56.724 --> 01:03:57.517
- I don't know.

1244
01:03:57.517 --> 01:03:58.482
I think it's the engine.

1245
01:04:00.275 --> 01:04:01.551
I do have to say

1246
01:04:01.551 --> 01:04:03.379
that vengeful stunt
that the driving father

1247
01:04:03.379 --> 01:04:04.896
pulled was a surprise.

1248
01:04:04.896 --> 01:04:06.413
Now I didn't plan on it.

1249
01:04:06.413 --> 01:04:10.068
Definitely made sitting this
trap a little more challenging,

1250
01:04:10.068 --> 01:04:11.724
but thankfully

1251
01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:13.034
I could prove to myself

1252
01:04:13.034 --> 01:04:15.517
that I could adapt in
a quick, decisive way.

1253
01:04:17.034 --> 01:04:18.965
I had an idea of who he might
be when I saw that bobble head

1254
01:04:18.965 --> 01:04:20.896
on his dashboard at the bar.

1255
01:04:20.896 --> 01:04:22.413
You didn't notice of course,

1256
01:04:22.413 --> 01:04:25.241
details Micah details.

1257
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:27.413
Then I knew who he was
when I saw a picture of him

1258
01:04:27.413 --> 01:04:28.896
and Jamie in his wallet.

1259
01:04:31.172 --> 01:04:32.000
Poor guy.

1260
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.172
But he had to go.

1261
01:04:36.413 --> 01:04:37.896
- Where you at, Dawn?

1262
01:04:37.896 --> 01:04:38.793
Where you at?

1263
01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:52.965
So all this for little
ole me, huh Dawn?

1264
01:04:52.965 --> 01:04:54.206
You really shouldn't have.

1265
01:04:54.206 --> 01:04:55.689
- Oh no, it needed to be done.

1266
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.965
- I really do like you, Dawn.

1267
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:43.827
- Finally.

1268
01:05:43.827 --> 01:05:46.724
I was wondering when your
bitch ass was gonna catch up.

1269
01:05:46.724 --> 01:05:48.137
- Oh, don't worry about nothing.

1270
01:05:48.137 --> 01:05:49.068
You gonna get the full
mechanic experience now bitch.

1271
01:05:51.068 --> 01:05:52.517
Uh uh, no you don't.

1272
01:05:53.793 --> 01:05:54.620
Ah, shit.

1273
01:06:00.793 --> 01:06:01.827
Yeah.

1274
01:06:03.862 --> 01:06:05.034
- Okay.

1275
01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:05.862
Hold on a second.

1276
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.827
Micah, don't be a pussy.

1277
01:06:10.827 --> 01:06:12.517
You wanna fight hand to hand?

1278
01:06:12.517 --> 01:06:13.344
Yeah?

1279
01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:15.965
Come on.

1280
01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:23.827
- Rest in peace, Dawn.

1281
01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:29.448
What the fuck?

1282
01:06:31.172 --> 01:06:33.965
- Oh, you didn't know
I was Bulletproof, huh?

1283
01:06:33.965 --> 01:06:35.517
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1284
01:06:41.448 --> 01:06:42.482
Ah, shit.

1285
01:06:47.931 --> 01:06:48.827
No, no.

1286
01:06:50.034 --> 01:06:50.965
Yeah.

1287
01:06:53.482 --> 01:06:54.689
- You fucking idiot.

1288
01:06:56.862 --> 01:06:57.620
- Bitch.

1289
01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:03.862
I guess I'm the idiot who
kicking your fucking ass, huh?

1290
01:07:07.172 --> 01:07:08.344
- Yeah, it hurts, doesn't it.

1291
01:07:14.551 --> 01:07:16.137
Sweetie,

1292
01:07:16.137 --> 01:07:18.724
the trap doesn't work until
the animal is caught, right?

1293
01:07:23.931 --> 01:07:26.862
Maybe it's time to
spring this one.

1294
01:08:03.758 --> 01:08:05.793
Hey, there's sleepy head.

1295
01:08:05.793 --> 01:08:07.000
You had a nice nap.

1296
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.827
- Dawn.

1297
01:08:09.275 --> 01:08:11.172
you better let me off this
fucking table right now,

1298
01:08:11.172 --> 01:08:12.482
so help me, God.

1299
01:08:12.482 --> 01:08:13.586
- Oh Micah,

1300
01:08:13.586 --> 01:08:14.413
I am your god.

1301
01:08:23.482 --> 01:08:25.448
I hope this all outfits
more comfortable.

1302
01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.033
- Untie me right fucking now.

1303
01:08:35.586 --> 01:08:37.310
What the fuck is that?

1304
01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:41.000
- Oh, Micah, you were such
a fucking disappointment.

1305
01:08:42.412 --> 01:08:45.068
With all of the experience
you have sawing your victims,

1306
01:08:45.068 --> 01:08:46.724
I thought you'd be
able to name this baby

1307
01:08:46.724 --> 01:08:48.000
by the make and model.

1308
01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.241
- Dawn.

1309
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:54.482
Dawn.

1310
01:08:54.482 --> 01:08:55.930
Dawn.

1311
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.586
Just listen to me, Dawn.

1312
01:08:57.586 --> 01:08:59.482
Just listen to me, okay.

1313
01:08:59.482 --> 01:09:00.551
Please don't do this.

1314
01:09:01.482 --> 01:09:03.310
Dawn, please.

1315
01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.448
Please.

1316
01:09:07.586 --> 01:09:09.620
Dawn, I would do
anything please.

1317
01:09:13.241 --> 01:09:15.136
- Just let it out.

1318
01:09:15.136 --> 01:09:16.724
Just follow the pattern.

1319
01:09:30.517 --> 01:09:31.344
- I,

1320
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:35.171
Dawn, I will do anything.

1321
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.103
I will do anything,
Dawn, please.

1322
01:09:38.379 --> 01:09:39.965
Please, just let me go.

1323
01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:41.379
- Is that what Jamie said?

1324
01:09:42.517 --> 01:09:43.344
Or Brooke?

1325
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:47.827
I know that's what Melanie said.

1326
01:09:49.412 --> 01:09:50.965
Cause I was there for that too.

1327
01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:56.172
She was my best friend
and you took her

1328
01:09:56.172 --> 01:09:59.620
from the Circle K parking
lot in Waupaca, Wisconsin

1329
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.206
at 2:22 in the morning

1330
01:10:01.206 --> 01:10:04.379
while I happened to go
inside for an energy drink.

1331
01:10:13.724 --> 01:10:14.551
- Please.

1332
01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:16.482
Please, stop.

1333
01:10:17.827 --> 01:10:19.310
- Came outside to an empty car

1334
01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.551
and I saw a man jump
into his nearby.

1335
01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:26.896
It was your second kill,

1336
01:10:26.896 --> 01:10:28.206
if I remember correctly.

1337
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:31.862
You were a lot
sloppier in those days.

1338
01:10:33.413 --> 01:10:35.068
But I never stopped.

1339
01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:36.551
- Dawn, just,

1340
01:10:36.551 --> 01:10:37.551
just.

1341
01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:38.551
- And I won't stop now.

1342
01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:39.965
- Okay please.

1343
01:10:39.965 --> 01:10:41.000
Dawn.

1344
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.724
Dawn.

1345
01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:46.000
You ain't gotta
be like me, Dawn.

1346
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.206
Just let me go,

1347
01:10:48.137 --> 01:10:49.655
please.

1348
01:11:33.413 --> 01:11:35.862
No, stop it, please.

1349
01:11:35.862 --> 01:11:37.931
Please stop, stop!

1350
01:11:52.931 --> 01:11:54.344
Dawn.

1351
01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.206
Dawn.

1352
01:11:55.206 --> 01:11:56.068
Dawn, Dawn.

1353
01:11:57.275 --> 01:11:58.379
Come here, Dawn.

1354
01:11:58.379 --> 01:12:00.068
Dawn, look at me.

1355
01:12:00.068 --> 01:12:01.586
Dawn.

1356
01:12:01.586 --> 01:12:03.862
Dawn.

1357
01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:04.827
Do it, bitch.

1358
01:12:35.655 --> 01:12:38.551
- Megan McCormick coming
to you live from TV 13,

1359
01:12:38.551 --> 01:12:40.965
a grizzly site today at
the old Chenworth barn.

1360
01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:43.206
The body of the infamous
"Mechanic Maniac"

1361
01:12:43.206 --> 01:12:44.482
has been discovered

1362
01:12:44.482 --> 01:12:46.827
alongside the body
of an Arizona man

1363
01:12:46.827 --> 01:12:48.344
who was found to be the father

1364
01:12:48.344 --> 01:12:52.034
of the maniac's most
recent victim, Jamie DeMay.

1365
01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.344
Local police are saying,

1366
01:12:53.344 --> 01:12:55.034
this is a cut and
dry case of revenge.

1367
01:12:55.034 --> 01:12:56.689
With the father
killing the mechanic

1368
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:58.034
and taking his
life with his gun.

1369
01:12:58.034 --> 01:12:59.586
- Can I get you anything else?

1370
01:12:59.586 --> 01:13:00.862
- Oh no thank you.

1371
01:13:00.862 --> 01:13:03.000
I got exactly what I wanted.

1372
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.344
- All right, you
have a good night.

1373
01:13:04.344 --> 01:13:07.862
♪ Carry on my wayward son

1374
01:13:07.862 --> 01:13:11.931
♪ There'll be peace
when you are done ♪

1375
01:13:11.931 --> 01:13:14.862
♪ lay your weary head to rest

1376
01:13:16.034 --> 01:13:18.517
don't you cry now more
